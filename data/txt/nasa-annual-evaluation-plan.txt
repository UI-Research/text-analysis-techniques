Vision
Exploring the secrets of the universe
for the benefit of all.
Mission
NASA explores the unknown in air and space,
innovates for the benefit of humanity, and
inspires the world through discovery.
Since 1958, NASA has led the peaceful exploration of space, advancing knowledge of Earth while making
discoveries about the furthest reaches of the universe. NASA research has advanced aeronautics, helped
develop the commercial space industry, and strengthened the U.S. economy. Our efforts in space help to
further the national economy, including through innovative commercial partnerships with American busi-
nesses. With the increasing threat of climate change, NASA's efforts to study and understand the Earth sys-
tem are of critical global significance. In addition, NASA's partnerships with academic institutions support a
robust science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce and promote diversity, equity,
and inclusion in the fields of science and technology.
NASA's long-term success will be largely determined by the strategic decisions and investments we make
today, as well as constant adherence to our five guiding Core Values.

Agency Priority Goals
NASA assesses progress toward achieving Agency Priority Goals every quarter, per GPRA Modernization Act
guidance. In addition to reporting progress to Agency leadership, we report progress to external stakehold-
ers through Performance.gov.
In January 2021, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) discontinued external reporting for the FY
2020-2021 Agency Priority Goals. NASA transitioned the four Agency Priority Goals to Performance Goals to
complete FY 2021 reporting. Below are the Performance Goals and their ratings for FY 2021, as well as the
original Agency Priority Goal description through FY 2020. Additional information can be found in Part 2.

Performance Management in Action
NASA is committed to remaining a good steward of the taxpayer's numerous investments entrusted to
our care. This includes maintaining a culture of data-driven performance management that continually
improves our performance management systems, increasing accountability, transparency, and oversight.
This approach leads to more consistent performance reporting across NASA's missions and ensures the
optimal use of our resources.
NASA plans and evaluates performance in a continuous cycle, spanning fiscal years, in conjunction with the
annual planning, programming, budgeting, and execution process used to ensure that resource alignment
supports mission and operational needs. This ongoing feedback loop ensures that plans reflect perfor-
mance expectations and, in return, those performance results inform planning decisions.
The GPRA Modernization Act requires agencies to set long-term Strategic Goals and Objectives, as well as
near-term Performance Goals. The GPRA Modernization Act also requires frequent data-driven perfor-

As stated above, NASA requires internal indepen-
dent assessments on the progress of programs and
projects through their life cycles. Senior leaders
convene a series of formal gatekeeping key deci-
sion point reviews, requiring managers to provide
assessments of how the programs and projects are
performing in key areas. Such key decision points
are specific milestones at which managers must
provide Agency leadership with information about
program maturity and readiness to progress to the
next stage of the life cycle (see the figure on page
17.).
The mandatory reviews at key decision point mile-
stones focus on the program or project's assess-

also have the opportunity to weigh in on the infor-

with cost and schedule updates for major projects
with an estimated lifecycle cost of $250 million or
greater.

Strategies for Improvement
NASA's commitment to good governance and stewardship of taxpayer funds requires that the Agency
routinely conducts internal assessments and evaluations to aid in maintaining, managing, and improving
operations. In addition, periodic external assessments focus management attention on areas of high risk or
potential difficulty. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the NASA Office of Inspector General
(OIG) conduct such external assessments, identifying trouble spots and recommending how to address
them. Issues raised by the GAO and OIG represent high-priority areas for management attention.
High Risk Areas Identified by the GAO
The GAO assesses management activities across the Federal Government and identifies practices and
vulnerabilities that put agencies at risk of fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement. The GAO's High Risk
List, updated every two years, has included NASA's acquisition management since the list was established
in 1990. To assist in corrective action planning, the GAO established five criteria that, if addressed, would
substantively improve operations and clear the GAO's concern about high-risk activity:
Leadership Commitment: Demonstrated strong commitment and top leadership support.
Capacity: Agency has the capacity (i.e., people and resources) to resolve the risk(s).
Action Plan: A corrective action plan exists that defines the root cause, solutions, and provides for
substantially completing corrective measures, including steps necessary to implement recommended
solutions.
Monitoring: A program has been instituted to monitor and independently validate the effectiveness and
sustainability of corrective measures.
Demonstrated Progress: Ability to demonstrate progress in implementing corrective measures and
resolving high-risk areas.

NASA is organized for success, with a leadership model that optimizes strategic direction at the Agency level,
facilitates management at the functional levels in the mission directorates and mission support offices, and
enables a wide range of activities at centers and facilities. The distributed and diverse nature of our work is
unified by an integrated performance culture that engages employees and stakeholders at all levels.
The innovative, responsive, and dynamic nature of our work benefits from the relationships within and
between Mission Directorates, Mission Support Offices, and Centers. This organizational model ensures our
leaders can take both a holistic and more narrowly focused approach to programmatic, operational, busi-
ness, and safety management.
Centers and Facilities Nationwide
NASA's best asset for achieving mission success is a diverse, multidisciplinary, and skilled workforce across
all Centers and facilities. NASA's approach to performance management is based on the premise that each
team member brings unique experience and important expertise to projects. NASA is committed to nurtur-
ing an organizational culture in which individuals make full use of their time, talent, and opportunities to
pursue the highest standards in engineering, research, operations, and management.

Bottom: This image from NASA's Juno mission captures the northern hemisphere of Jupiter around the region known as Jet N7. The planet's strong winds
create the many swirling storms visible near the top of its atmosphere. Data from Juno helped scientists discover another, less visible effect of those winds:
Jupiter's powerful magnetic field changes over time. The winds extend more than 1800 miles (3000 kilometers) deep, where the material lower in Jupiter's
atmosphere is highly conductive, electrically. Scientists determined that the wind shears this conductive material apart and carries it around the planet, which
changes the shape of the magnetic field. Image Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/MSSS

Less than half of Earth's 1,400 subaerial (existing
in open air) volcanoes have ground monitor-
ing because of practical limitations, especially
at remote or heavily vegetated volcanoes.
Researchers developed the first archive of both
satellite and ground-based seismic, deforma-
tion, degassing, and thermal data to quantify the
amount of detectable volcanic activity in the United
States and its territories. The researchers found
that 96 volcanoes in the United States showed
some type of volcanic activity, including thermal
activity at 30 volcanoes newly identified from
analysis by the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal
Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER)
sensor. Researchers also used the Multi-angle
Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), the Moderate
Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS),
and the Ozone Measuring Instrument (OMI) to
classify and track volcanic emissions from Icelandic
volcanoes based on content and ash particle size.
They used these data to illustrate the potential
to distinguish qualitative differences in eruptive
magma composition based on particle light absorp-
tion and plume profile from remote sensing.
Human activities releasing greenhouse gases
and aerosols into the atmosphere disrupt Earth's
energy balance between absorbed sunlight and
emitted thermal radiative energy, with a net effect
of causing Earth's surface and atmosphere to
warm. The additional energy being added to the
system by humans, previously estimated by mod-
els, has now been inferred by researchers using
16 years of measurements from the Clouds and
the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) and
Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) instruments
aboard the Aqua satellite. They used a new tech-
nique to parse out how much of the total energy
change is caused by humans, finding that 0.5 Watts
per square meter of energy were added between
2003 and 2018, primarily because of anthropogenic
greenhouse gas emissions from such processes as
power generation, transport, and industrial manu-
facturing, and secondarily because of reduction in
reflective aerosols.

lower atmosphere. The studies also confirm shock
acceleration as a major acceleration mechanism.
Changes in thermospheric mass density impact the
aerodynamic drag on space vehicles and debris in
the near-Earth space environments. Cooling of the
mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) results
in a decrease in its temperature and density, which
results in less aerodynamic drag and leads to
longer lifetimes for debris on orbit. A recent study
by the TIMED mission reveals that the MLT has
cooled dramatically since 2002 and suggests that
the MLT in 2020 was colder than at any other time
since the late 1700s. The long-term cooling effects
are attributed to increasing carbon dioxide due to
climate changes and weakening solar cycles.
Researchers have developed new methodologies
to understand coronal mass ejection propagation
using heliospheric images from the Solar Terrestrial
Relations Observatory (STEREO) mission, improv-
ing the capability to predict arrival time at Earth.
Furthermore, there has been significant progress
made in global integrated models of the solar
corona and heliosphere, in particular to under-
stand the build-up of magnetic energy that leads to
solar eruptive events.

FY 2021 Performance Progress
NASA-supported researchers published 455
peer-reviewed studies on physical and biological
sciences, exceeding the FY 2021 target of 360. This
target was based on FY 2020 performance, which
was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The pace

accessibility and use of NASA data by its existing
and new user communities. NASA's data initiatives
are focused on making actionable data accessible
to other Federal agencies, relevant decision-mak-

by investments in three key areas: 1) capabilities to
enable open-source science; 2) continuous evolu-

airplanes of tomorrow, such as the Transonic Truss-Braced Wing (TTBW) concept shown in the image above, are currently being tested by researchers and
engineers. The TTBW is essentially a classic tube-and-wing passenger aircraft whose wings are extremely long and thin - so much that they need a little
help to hold them up. By narrowing the thickness of the wings and extending their length, drag is reduced, and 5-10% less fuel is burned than comparable
narrowbody aircraft. This image was created using data from a computational fluid dynamics simulation - essentially a virtual wind tunnel test. The red
and
orange areas represent higher drag, and the green and blue areas represent lower drag. Note the beautifully sleek green-blue color of the wings - the colors

integrates risk across hazards as part of the in-time
system-wide safety assurance capabilities for
highly autonomous emerging operations. NASA has
incorporated multiple key hazards, such as wind
gusts, propulsion degradations, and proximity to
buildings and populated areas, into the computa-
tion of a set of risk metrics and algorithms that may
be used during pre-flight planning or in-flight. The
project tested these automated risk assessment
techniques in simulation using flight logs. A sub-
set will be demonstrated during live flight testing

In 2020, NASA added Inclusion to our Core Values,
recognizing that inclusion is intrinsic to our
work, our relationships, and our achievements.
Inclusion increases collaboration and productivity.
Additionally, it encourages employees to go above-

want to feel a sense of inclusion and belonging.
Inclusion happens when people can have psy-

as reported on the FY 2020 OMB Scorecard for
Efficient Federal Operations/Management. Of the
seven sustainability areas assessed by OMB, NASA
received five Green and two Yellow ratings.
Performance in Efficiency Measures / Investment
was Yellow because COVID-19 delayed energy/
water evaluations at four of 12 sites, which caused
the percentage of facilities evaluated over the past
four years to be below the required 90 percent.
Performance in Transportation/Fleet Management
was Yellow because a reporting issue in FY 2019
resulted in underreporting of petroleum fuel use
in covered fleet vehicles. Because personnel were
offsite due to COVID-19, the issue was not discov-
ered on time to correct the error for FY 2019. That
underreporting error caused an artificial year-over-
year increase from FY 2019 to FY 2020. We have
corrected the error.

FY 2021 Performance Progress
NASA achieved this multiyear Performance Goal by
keeping the ratio of unscheduled maintenance to
total maintenance well below the FY 2021 target of
21.34 percent. NASA's achieved a performance of
17.37 percent which is the lowest ratio of unsched-
uled maintenance to total maintenance since the
baseline was set at 31.6 percent in 2015.
NASA performs scheduled maintenance on its
equipment to keep it in good operating condition.
When equipment fails, we must perform unsched-
uled maintenance to repair it. The percentage
of unscheduled maintenance spending to total
maintenance spending is an indicator of the overall
condition of the equipment. More unscheduled
maintenance indicates that the equipment has
become unreliable and unplanned failures and
outages become more frequent, which can delay
mission activities, such as manufacturing and test-
ing. As NASA increases the use of Condition Based
Maintenance, unplanned failures become sched-
uled maintenance as potential failures are detected
before they occur. This has also contributed to an
improvement in this metric.

FY 2021 Performance Progress
NASA achieved the Performance Goal for partner-
ship agreements in FY 2021. At the end of FY 2021,
NASA had 2,163 domestic and 589 international
active partnership agreements, for a total of 2,752
agreements (exceeding the target of 2,404).
To expand the Agency's strategic partnerships and
meet our mission objectives, we focused on out-
reach efforts to attract new, non-traditional orga-
nizations, while continuing to expand partnerships
with existing partners. NASA personnel across the
Agency conducted numerous outreach meetings
and participated in virtual forums and conferences
identifying and engaging with potential partners.
Due largely to these and other similar outreach ini-
tiatives, NASA entered into partnership agreements
with 107 new (first-time) non-Federal partners.
Reaching new audiences regarding NASA partner-
ship opportunities and increasing the number and
types of new partners benefits the Agency by culti-
vating new and innovative collaboration opportuni-

Annual Evaluation Plan
NASA's FY 2023 Annual Evaluation Plan
The Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018 (Evidence Act) Title I reinforces and supports
Federal evidence-building activities, the Open, Public, Electronic, and Necessary (OPEN) Government Data
Act, and the Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act (CIPSEA). The Evidence Act Title
I requires Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act agencies to publish an Annual Evaluation Plan (AEP) that conveys
significant evaluations across the Agency each fiscal year, developed in coordination with the Agency Perfor-
mance Plan. The AEP establishes and informs NASA's key stakeholders about planned evaluations. Evalua-
tions will uncover findings that will inform NASA program budgets, the Strategic Plan and Learning Agenda,
annual Strategic Review, ongoing program management and development, and integrate evidence into the
performance planning process.
Evaluation Culture
Evaluation Standards
NASA relies on a culture of evidence-based, data-driven research designs and methodologies to evaluate
its programs, policies, and organizations across the Agency. Evaluation, as defined by the Evidence Act, is
an assessment using systematic data collection and analysis of one or more programs, policies, or organi-
zations intended to assess their effectiveness and efficiency. The AEP details only those NASA evaluations
that meet the Agency's definition of "significant" evaluations (see Figure 1 below). Led by NASA's Evaluation
Officer, in conjunction with the Statistical Officer and Chief Data Officer, five standards guide NASA's evalua-
tion culture: rigor, relevance and utility, independence and objectivity, transparency, and ethics. These stan-
dards, in addition to the criteria established for "significant" evaluations are the foundation that NASA uses
to support its array of evaluation activities.

APPENDIX A
FY 2023 Annual Evaluation Plan
Purpose
The AEP identifies planned "significant" evaluations from across the Agency. It serves as a means to inform
Agency senior officials and the public where the most significant evaluations are conducted, cultivate data
sharing and resources between NASA organizations, and provide information to help support the Agency's
evidence-driven culture.
Dissemination and Sharing
NASA has long been committed to disseminating and sharing results from its evidence-building activities
with the greater scientific community and, when permissible, making this information broadly available to
the public. As detailed in NASA Procedural Requirement (NPR) 2200.2D - Requirements for Documentation,
Approval and Dissemination of Scientific and Technical Information, the Agency strives for the widest prac-
ticable and appropriate dissemination of information concerning its activities and scientific and technical
information. NASA will leverage this framework in sharing findings from its "significant" evaluations.
The Agency's dissemination framework includes an array of symposium presentations, peer reviewed
journal publications, and NASA internal and external council discussions. Agency evaluations that provide
promising and effective findings are systematically and broadly disseminated to potential beneficiaries and
to Federal agency partners. Criteria and requirements for the dissemination of symposia lectures and pa-
pers, in addition to journal materials beyond the Agency, are detailed in Chapter 5 of NPR 2200.2D to ensure
proper review of substantive content, technical accuracy, overall quality, and value to the larger scientific
community. The Evaluation Officer, as well as Mission Directorate Associate Administrators and Center Di-
rectors, have responsibility for the technical, scientific, and programmatic accuracy of information released
externally from the Agency by their respective programs.
While NASA maintains a free exchange of scientific and technological information among scientists and engi-
neers, between NASA staff and the scientific community, and between NASA employees and the public, the
AEP is a formal dissemination of "significant" evaluations. Table 1, below, depicts broad evaluation dissemi-
nation methods by stakeholder groups and the formats used to share significant evaluations.

NASA's Criteria for Defining "Significant" Evaluations
NASA has an extensive evidence culture that leverages the findings from the numerous evaluations per-
formed across the Agency to make evidence-based decisions that support NASA's mission, foster a culture
of evaluation, and promote better value for the public. While the Agency considers every evaluation import-
ant, some rise to the level to influence policy and program decisions. To determine these "significant" evalu-
ations, NASA has formulated criteria in accordance with the Evidence Act. These criteria identify NASA's most
"significant" evaluations and include those that fit one or more of the criteria illustrated in Figure 1.

FY 2023 Significant Evaluations
Technology Investment
NASA invests in innovative early stage technology concepts that could lead to future breakthrough capabil-
ities and enable new paradigms or new mission types in the longer-term. NASA is evaluating its strategy for
investments in early stage innovation that help enable these potential breakthroughs of tomorrow. Diversity
is a key aspect of an early stage investment and partnership strategy. Enabling technology breakthroughs
of the future requires NASA to look to diverse sources for ideas and innovation. Companies-small and
large, academia, research institutions, students, individual inventors and hobbyists, NASA researchers and
others can all provide rich inputs to a thriving innovation ecosystem.
NASA's STMD early stage programs have encouraged participation from underserved and underrepre-
sented communities-including women and women-owned businesses; socially and economically disad-
vantaged individuals, businesses, and research institutions; and entrepreneurs living in or whose busi-
nesses are located and operate in states with a lower number of awards-in technology development
activities through outreach activities. For example, the Small Business Innovative Research/Small Business
Technology Transfer (SBIR/STTR), NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC), and the Space Technology Re-
search Grants (STRG) programs have increased their outreach and communications to underserved and un-
derrepresented communities, including Historically Black College and Universities (HBCU) and Minority
Serving Institutions (MSI). The SBIR/STTR programs have supported 15 Technology Infusion Road tours
which have attracted over 1,200 participants and have resulted in some increased participation in STTR
proposals. From 2010-2020, approximately 10% of SBIR/STTR Phase I awards have been to minority owned
firms. Additionally, NIAC has seen an increase in female grant awardees from 5.6% in 2013 to 12% in recent
years. STRG's largest awards - the four Space Technology Research Institutes (STRIs) - all feature MSI partic-
ipation. One STRI is now led by an MSI university, which recently achieved MSI status, post award. Despite
these improvements, NASA believes that more MSIs and HBCUs could be engaged and contributing to space
technology research and innovation.
Outreach alone does not sufficiently address the underlying factors that create challenges for underserved
and underrepresented community participation, thus limiting NASA's community of innovation. Efforts
to understand the core capabilities that exist at HBCUs and MSIs and to identify synergies between those
capabilities and NASA core competencies will help NASA develop a more effective platform of informa-
tion sharing and relationship building with HBCUs/MSIs. Additionally, working with a third party deeply
familiar with the challenges HBCUs and MSIs face in securing government research funding and identifying
small business partners will enable NASA to evaluate relevant factors related to its goals. Through these ef-
forts, NASA seeks to develop a more diverse pipeline of innovative solutions and increase HBCU/MSI access
to funding and small business partners.
Accordingly, over the last couple years, NASA has begun piloting new approaches to engagement
with HBCUs and MSI. In August 2020, through the Minority University Research and Education Proj-
NASA's FY 2023 Volume of Integrated Performance
135
APPENDIX A
FY 2023 Annual Evaluation Plan
ect (MUREP) Space Technology Artemis Research (M-STAR) initiative, NASA awarded $604,000 to 15 HBCUs
and MSIs to strengthen and develop research capacity in areas of strategic importance to NASA STMD. In
August 2021, NASA then awarded 11, $50,000 planning grants through the MUREP-STTR (M-STTR) initiative
specifically to foster partnerships between MSIs and small businesses and prepare them to submit technol-
ogy proposals to NASA's annual STTR Phase I solicitation. Also during 2021, SBIR/STTR entered a five-year
cooperative agreement with the MSI STEM Research and Development Consortium (MSRDC) to leverage
their work in connecting HBCUs and MSIs with research and development sponsors, and to gain additional
insights into specific factors that may influence HBCU and MSI participation in NASA SBIR/STTR.
During FY 2022, NASA anticipates that we will have evaluated the results of the aforementioned MUREP ini-
tiatives, with particular focus on M-STTR grantee participation and success in the STTR Phase I solicitation
process. Also, during FY 2022, we anticipate that our partnership with MSRDC will have resulted in a forma-
tive evaluation, identifying an array of factors that potentially serve as challenges or barriers to entry for
HBCU and MSI participation in NASA SBIR/STTR. The results of our FY 2022 evaluation activities will directly
inform our FY 2023 evaluation.
Building on our FY 2022 results, NASA will select specific factor(s) that show significant potential to expand
NASA's early stage innovation community through increased HBCU and MSI contribution. We will then
design and implement at least one targeted impact evaluation in FY 2023 to test the impact of NASA inter-
vention related to the identified factor(s). NASA plans to work closely with both the GSA Office of Evaluation
Services (OES) and MSRDC to develop the experimental design and conduct the evaluation.
Theory of Change
If NASA can better understand the core capabilities that exist at HBCUs and MSIs, identify synergies between
those capabilities and NASA core competencies, and directly address specific factors that serve as potential
barriers to entry, then NASA will see increased HBCU and MSI participation in early stage innovation pro-
grams, which will ultimately lead to an expanded, more diverse innovation community and result in more
novel ideas to seed tomorrow's space technology breakthroughs.
Data and Information
This evaluation will undertake active data collection through MSRDC, who will work directly with
HBCUs and MSIs as well as from customer experience surveys. In addition, existing data from the program's
proposal processes, including M-STTR results, will be analyzed.

Challenges
Since the HBCU/MSI community is small, getting enough participants will rely on active marketing through
a well-connected community intermediary. The ability to get qualitative data about past successful STTR
awardee partnership characteristics will be limited by the size of the pool and their willingness to provide
information. NASA seeks to leverage MSRDC's long standing relationships with the HBCU/MSI community to
communicate results and provide study data.
Dissemination Strategies
The results will be shared broadly within NASA to all programs concerned with increasing the participation
of underserved and underrepresented communities, with the caveat that this evaluation will focus on the
intersection of successful small business and research institution partnerships-a core part of lab-to-mar-
ket efforts. These results could inform experiments as programmatic strategies to be considered by other
programs that engage the small business, entrepreneur or research community within other early stage
programs, the Office of STEM Engagement (OSTEM), and the Office of Small Business Programs (OSBP). Eval-
uation results would benefit other agencies' SBIR/STTR programs and the Small Business Administration on
ways to increase participation.
Timeframe
The evaluation design will be finalized in FY 2022, and evaluation will occur by the end of FY 2023.
Industrial Base
NASA and the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), National Oceanic and At-
mospheric Administration (NOAA), National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS),
will conduct an evaluation of the factors that drive efficiency in the NASA and United States civil space sup-
ply chain network.
This multi-year collaboration will build upon a substantial record of space sector analysis conducted be-
tween BIS, NASA and the broader U.S. Government (USG) to identify traits that benefit or impede the cur-
rent health and competitiveness of the civil segment of the U.S. Space Industrial Base (SIB). Early findings
will also inform the planning and execution of the civil space provisions of the 2020 National Space Policy
(NSP). NASA and DOC (NOAA) seek visibility into the current and prospective performance of the civil space
community to achieve enhanced situational awareness in times of uncertainty. Furthermore, survey re-
sponses from firms in the sector are expected help illuminate the impacts of COVID-19, M&A, disruptive

technology, changing workforce dynamics and other supply chain issues.
Theory of Change
If NASA can better understand the industrial base ecosystem in the civil space sector, then NASA may be
able to better forecast pressures, anticipate risks, and mitigate against forces that obstruct the aerospace
supply chain to drive adaptability and enhance decision making.
Evaluation Question(s)
What are the underlying factors and to what extent do these factors affect the aerospace industrial base to sup-
port Federal civil space acquisition and development?
NASA will evaluate this question through a survey and analysis that looks at the supply chain and underlying
factors related to the aerospace industrial base. This evaluation seeks to address impacts to the aerospace
supply chain through the following factors:
Impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic;
Corporate financial distress;
Mergers and acquisitions;
Costs related to foreign sourcing, offshoring of critical supply chain components,
and alternatively, reshoring;
Disruptive new technologies, including advances in artificial intelligence,
quantum computing, and additive manufacturing;
Changing workforce dynamics including emphasis on STEM practices;
Cybersecurity investments and cybercrime impacts; and
Constraints related to U.S. Federal acquisition reforms.

Methods to be used and Evaluation Design
NASA will undertake a non-experimental formative evaluation design to analyze survey results, including a
time series analysis of responses over the course of three observation years:
FY 2021: Survey development, testing, distribution, and organization of mailing list and portal
hosted by the Census Bureau;
FY 2022: Survey analysis of roughly 500 completed survey responses in Wave 1 compiled,
analyzed, briefed and shared;
FY 2023: Survey analysis and comparison of roughly 500 - 1,000 completed survey responses
in Wave 2 compiled, analyzed, briefed, and shared.
Further evaluation design details are under discussion, with several options, techniques, and tools under
consideration. Final determination is expected to be made by the end of the calendar year 2021.
Challenges
Anticipated challenges include willingness of survey respondents to provide detailed current and historical
information regarding performance, financials, and supply chain issues. Additional challenges include ability
of analysts to evaluate large datasets and assess impacts to NASA and other space agencies.
Dissemination Strategies
A final dissemination plan has not yet been approved. Initial considerations suggest a wide dissemination
within NASA to all impacted programs, the broader U.S. civil space community, including primary space

agencies and associated partners. In addition, a summary of findings is likely to be disseminated to relevant
stakeholders including the Administration, Congress, industry, academia, and the public.
Timeframe
The timeframe for this evaluation is FY 2021-FY 2023.
Internship Outcomes
The purpose of the Internship Outcome Assessment Year 2 Study is to measure students' immediate out-
comes of participating in a NASA internship and assess how and to what extent interns are contributing to
NASA's missions. Additionally, this study will identify sources of group differences and address how NASA
can continue to broaden participation of students from historically underrepresented groups in STEM fields.
This study will build upon the Year 1 findings, expanding the scope of the pre-post assessment and com-
paring Year 1 findings to Year 2 findings. The results of this study are intended to be used for programmatic
improvement.
Theory of Change
If NASA increases the number of interns from underrepresented and underserved communities who apply
to and are accepted for a NASA internship, there will be an increase in contributions to NASA's work from
diverse viewpoints and lead to full time employment that will strengthen the potential for a more diverse
future workforce.
Evaluation Question(s)
The following evaluation questions may guide the approach and design of this outcome assessment:
1. To what extent is participation in NASA internships associated with
a. intern satisfaction with the program?
b. interns' self-reported gains in science and research-related outcomes?
C. interns' likelihood to pursue future STEM-related activities, education, and careers?
2. Are there any differences in interns' reports based upon underrepresented group status?
3. What insight do mentors provide on the intern program?
4. How do mentors characterize interns' contributions to NASA's missions?
5. Do interns demonstrate growth toward mastery of 21st Century Skills across
the duration of the internship as assessed by their mentor?

The 21st Century Skills Assessment is an objective assessment measure that is completed by each
interns' mentor regarding their progress toward mastery of important 21st Century skills (Sondergeld
& Johnson, 2016). Mentors assess each intern in a pre/post manner. The first assessment will be
completed in the first days of the program (pre). The second assessment will be completed at the
end of the program (post). The assessment is used to determine the growth toward mastery for
each participant during their time in the internship. Mentors rate each participants' skills in six do-

3. Communication, Collaboration, Social, and Cross-Cultural Skills
4. Information, Media, & Technological Literacy
5. Flexibility, Adaptability, Initiative, and Self-Direction
6. Productivity, Accountability, Leadership, and Responsibility
Methods to be used and Evaluation Design
This study will use both quantitative and qualitative methods to analyze survey data. Quantitative data will
be summarized using descriptive statistics such as numbers of respondents, frequencies and proportions
of responses, average response when responses categories are assigned to a Likert scale (e.g., 1 = "Never
Used" to 4 = "Used Every day"), and standard deviations. Emergent coding will be used for the qualitative
data to identify the most common themes in responses.
Inferential statistics will be used to identify sources of group differences and in support of NASA's goal to
broaden participation of historically underrepresented groups in STEM fields. Statistical significance will be
determined with t-tests, chi-square tests, or various non-parametric tests as appropriate, with significance
defined at p < 0.05. Because statistical significance is sensitive to the number of respondents, it is more diffi-
cult to detect significant changes with small numbers of respondents. Therefore, practical significance, also
known as effect size, will be reported when differences are statistically significant.
21st Century Skills Assessment data will be analyzed using 2-Between, 2-Within Repeated-Measures ANOVAs
to examine potential differences from pre- to post-observation by underrepresented group status and set-
ting. Descriptive and inferential statistics will be included.

Since NASA's inception, scientific discovery regarding Earth, the Sun, the solar system, and the universe
beyond has been an enduring purpose of the Agency. NASA conducts scientific exploration enabled by
observatories that view Earth from space, observe and visit other bodies in the solar system, and gaze out
into the galaxy and beyond. NASA's science programs focus on three interdisciplinary objectives: discovering
the secrets of the universe, searching for life in the solar system and beyond, and protecting and improving
life on Earth.

NASA's 2021 Strategic Review determined that Strategic Objective 1.1 showed Satisfactory Performance.
Programs and projects within the science portfolio had clear strategies in place to achieve the objectives
described in the 2018 Strategic Plan. External experts again rated NASA's FY 2020 progress for the nine sup-
porting science Performance Goals as having met or exceeded expectations. While the COVID-19 pandemic
has had and will continue to have significant impacts, evaluations of near, mid, and long-term objectives
provide sufficient evidence that SMD projects effectively support Strategic Objective 1.1.
NASA uses the recommendations of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's
decadal surveys as an important input in planning and prioritizing the future of its science programs. For
almost 50 years, decadal surveys have proven vital in establishing a broad consensus within the national
science community on the state of science, the highest priority science questions to address, and actions
that can be undertaken to answer those questions. NASA uses these recommendations to prioritize future
flight missions, as well as technology development and proposals for theoretical and suborbital supporting
research. In determining the content of the science portfolio, NASA also considers national priorities and
policies, actual budgets, existing technological capabilities, partnership opportunities, and other program-
matic factors.
While COVID-19 has resulted in substantial cost and launch readiness impacts for missions in formulation
and development, NASA has continually assessed changing needs in order to focus resources on critical
activities. Such efforts enabled the on-time launch and successful landing of the Mars 2020 mission to seek
signs of life on Mars. The mission's Ingenuity Mars helicopter performed the first powered, controlled flight
of an aircraft on another planet, then transitioned into an operations demonstration that includes recon-
naissance of scientifically interesting sites that are outside the areas planned for access by the Perseverance
rover.

NASA also launched the Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich satellite to continue the multi-decadal observational
record of ocean altimetry, conducted a successful asteroid sample collection at Bennu (OSIRIS-REx), and
completed integration and test of the James Webb Space Telescope in preparation for launch in early Fiscal
Year 2022. NASA confirmed the VIPER lunar rover project, which will conduct investigations of volatile distri-
butions on the Moon, and completed the Critical Design Review for Europa Clipper, which will investigate the
habitability of Jupiter's moon Europa. The Parker Solar Probe continued its prime mission as it flew within 16
Solar Radii of the Sun's surface in 2021.

The International Space Station (ISS), conceived and constructed to be a laboratory in space, provides oppor-
tunities to understand the role of gravity in physical and biological systems. As a research and technology
development facility, the ISS provides the capability for human-tended, long-duration space-based research,
which is critical to the research and development of technologies supporting Artemis and future deep space
exploration. ISS research also supports investigations in human physiology and biotechnology. As NASA's
only current long-duration, crewed orbital testbed, the ISS is used by researchers to study the effects of
long-duration exposure to the space environment on the crew and devise and test countermeasures to
offset health risks.

FY 2021 Summary of Progress Update
The 2021 Strategic Review determined that Strategic Objective 1.2 showed Satisfactory Performance towards
achieving the strategy described in the 2018 Strategic Plan. NASA funded and is performing research studies
that address the known risks as defined by the current human exploration plan. NASA also established
broad-based partnerships with other U.S. government agencies, private industry, and international partners
to advance scientific space-based research and technology development aboard the International Space
Station (ISS).
NASA's strategy for prioritizing and enabling fundamental physical and biological systems research is
guided by several studies released by the National Academies' over the past two decades, including the 2011
decadal survey Recapturing a Future for Space Exploration: Life and Physical Sciences Research for a New. We
continued to develop the parameters of the next decadal survey on physical and life sciences; the outcome
of the decadal survey will inform future research priorities. Mid-term goals will be established based on this
new decadal survey and will be prioritized and executed as supported by the budget.
New Space Act agreements are testing the marketplace for commercially viable low Earth orbital platforms
to advance human subject and biological and physical sciences research beyond the ISS program. NASA
has well-established outreach to industry, academia, and international agencies and will continue to lever-
age these partnerships to advance NASA exploration goals and for enhancing space physical and biological
studies.
Due to COVID-19 protocols, the Human Research Program (HRP) and Biological and Physical Sciences (BPS)
personnel who contribute to achievement of this Strategic Objective have limited access to laboratories to
conduct research as planned. However, during FY 2021, HRP has the highest priority for ISS utilization, and
all HRP inflight requirements are being met, with nine ISS studies in progress. Consistent with the 2020
Strategic Review assessment, grant extensions were necessary and there were impacts to project develop-
ment schedules and costs.
Beginning with the 2022 Strategic Review, the BPS portfolio contributes to the achievement of Strategic
Objective 1.2 and the HRP portfolio will support achievement of Strategic Objective 2.3.

The 2021 Strategic Review determined that Strategic Objective 2.1 achieved Satisfactory Performance. NASA
continued the targeted strategy, which was sustainable, cost effective, safe, and built on and applied the
many lessons learned from over a decade of work and experience with commercial companies. NASA estab-
lished the Commercial LEO Development program office in the third quarter of FY 2020, and in FY 2021,
we updated the commercial use and private astronaut pricing policy. NASA successfully released the final
Commercial LEO Destinations solicitation and conducted a Pre-Proposal Conference in the third quarter,
including one-on-ones with industry. Commercial LEO Destinations proposals were due in the fourth quar-
ter, with awards made in December 2021.
The Commercial LEO Development program continued to execute the strategy focused on engagement with
potential commercial providers. The first private astronaut mission (PAM) to the ISS was with Axiom Space's
Ax-1 mission, which launched on April 8 aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon vehicle. Proposals for the next two
PAMs to the ISS were received in FY 2021 fourth quarter. In FY 2021, nearly a dozen Space Act Agreements
and one PAM contract have been executed.
NASA plans to launch at least five technology demonstrations in FY 2021, further extending insight and
knowledge into critical capabilities necessary for deep space exploration. NASA exceed expectations
launching seven technology demonstrations to the ISS in FY 2021. Technology demonstrations initiated on
orbit include Astrobee, Spacesuit Evaporation Rejection Flight Experiment (SERFE), Spacecraft Fire Safety
(Saffire) V, Water Processor Assembly (WPA) Cat Reactor, Brine Processor Assembly (BPA), Universal Waste
Management System (UWMS), Airborne Particulate Monitor, and the Collapsible Contingency Urinal (CCU).
NASA is enabling a space-based low Earth orbit economy by transitioning the ISS operations and mainte-
nance to commercial and international partners, while continuing to leverage ISS for research and technol-
ogy development. NASA continues to work with the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space (CASIS)
to implement the findings and recommendations of the 2020 Independent Review Team report. In FY 2021,
NASA and CASIS initiated several actions designed to realign CASIS activities with NASA's evolving commer-
cial goals, including the development of new metrics designed to measure CASIS performance, and the
development of a new, more transparent selection model for proposals.

FY 2021 Summary of Progress Update
The Orion program has increased in scope to include development of a docking capability, supporting
increasingly complex missions. As a result of this increase in scope, COVID-19 impacts, and other factors, the
Orion program rebaselined.
Orion, SLS, and EGS, achieved major technical, programmatic, and acquisition milestones in FY 2021. The
Orion crew capsule was delivered to the EGS program at Kennedy Space Center for processing activities on
January 14, 2021, and SLS successfully completed the year-long Green Run series of tests at Stennis Space
Center on March 18, 2021. On April 27, 2021, the SLS Core Stage was shipped from Stennis Space Center to
Kennedy Space Center for integration and readiness activities that will lead to the Artemis I launch, which
was planned for late 2021 at the time this update was written.
Development on Artemis Il and III hardware progressed, with the Artemis Il Crew module undergoing
environmental and propulsion system processing at Kennedy Space Center. EGS completed their Artemis Il
checkpoint in late FY 2021 fourth quarter, successfully demonstrating that the program's plans and designs
that will be used to process, launch, and recover the crewed Artemis II mission are at a Critical Design
Review (CDR) level and meet requirements with acceptable margin, risk, and constraints.
Gateway program design and development activities also progressed, with a series of element-level design
reviews in FY 2021. The Gateway program was developing initial cost and schedule estimates, in prepara-
tion for the scheduled program Key Decision Point (KDP)-I in FY 2022. In FY 2021, the Gateway program
signed Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) with the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), the Japan Aerospace
Exploration Agency (JAXA), and the European Space Agency (ESA) for the development and provision of key
Gateway elements and capabilities. In FY 2020, NASA announced that the Power and Propulsion Element
(PPE) and the Habitation and Logistics Outpost (HALO) would be co-manifested on a single commercial
launch vehicle, eliminating the need for two separate launch vehicles and on-orbit assembly. In February
2021, NASA selected SpaceX to launch the PPE/HALO co-manifested vehicle.
NASA is pursuing a strategy that engages with industry in developing a sustainable lunar landing capabil-
ity. In FY 2021 first quarter, NASA completed the Human Landing System (HLS) Continuation Reviews and
reviewed the HLS Option A proposals addressing the first lunar landing missions. The three HLS base period
contracts were originally scheduled to complete at the end of February 2021; however, NASA issued no-cost
extensions through April 30, 2021, to allow NASA to complete the Option A selection and award process
and to preserve the ability to seamlessly transition from the base period contracts to the Option A contract
vehicle.
NASA announced on April 16, 2021, that we selected SpaceX to continue development of the first commercial
HLS under the Artemis program. On April 26, we were notified that Blue Origin Federation and Dynetics filed
protests challenging the HLS Option A selection with the Government Accountability Office (GAO). On April
30, we implemented a no-cost extension through August 9, 2021, to each of the base period HLS contracts
(Blue Origin Federation, Dynetics, and SpaceX).
On July 30, GAO denied the Blue Origin Federation and Dynetics protests. NASA then completed HLS Option
A Authorization to Proceed with SpaceX. We were notified on August 16 that the Blue Origin Federation
had filed a protest with the U.S. Court of Federal Claims following the denial of their protest with the GAO.
Subsequently, we voluntarily paused work with SpaceX for the HLS Option A contract, effective August 19
through November 1. All parties agreed to an expedited litigation schedule that concluded on November 1
with the U.S. Court of Federal Claims ruling in NASA's favor.
The COVID-19 pandemic impacted workforce availability and hardware development across the Exploration
Systems Development Division (ESD) and Advanced Exploration Systems (AES) portfolio, reflecting significant
COVID supplier and performance challenges. Early calculations showed up to 35 percent overall growth to
baseline plans on multiple critical activities from March 2020 through September FY 2021. In certain critical
activities, growth included general ongoing inefficiency impacts of approximately 10 percent.

progress made towards demonstration of a range of space technologies (e.g., Low-Earth Orbit Flight Test of
an Inflatable Decelerator (LOFTID), Deep Space Optical Communications (DSOC), Laser Communications Relay
Demonstration (LCRD)).
Although Strategic Objective 3.1 has a clear strategy for success, there have been impacts due to the COVID-19
pandemic. Some technology maturation and demonstration projects are experiencing cost and schedule impacts
due to restricted facility access, supply chain disruptions, and testing delays. For example, restricted access to
Jet Propulsion Laboratory facilities caused a delay to the final Autonomous Pop-Up Flat Folding Explorer Robot
(A-PUFFER) test, leading to a delayed Agency Priority Goal FY 2020 milestone; this milestone was completed in
May 2021. Some early-stage projects as well as commercial sector partnerships have experienced disruptions due
to the inability to access research facilities. NASA's small business partners are facing similar disruptions due to
facility closures, supply chain disruptions, and difficulties in teleworking. Additional delays could impact projects'
abilities to secure partnerships with industry, academia, and other government agencies, thereby further erod-
ing schedule and deliveries.
While some STMD projects were experiencing cost, schedule, technical, and/or programmatic challenges, the
STMD portfolio were on track overall to meet its Strategic Objective and included several technology demon-
strations planned for the next few years. Examples include Deep Space Optical Communications (DSOC), LOFTID,
Polar Resources Ice Mining Experiment (PRIME)-1, On-Orbit Servicing, Assembly, and Manufacturing (OSAM)
2, Blue Origin Demo of Deorbit, Descent, and Landing Sensors (BODDL-TP), and the Cislunar Autonomous
Positioning System Technology Operations and Navigation Experiment (CAPSTONE) small spacecraft demonstra-
tion. In the mid- to long-term, STMD has identified 16 long-term outcomes as priority areas of focus, each of
which addresses anticipated gaps across multiple stakeholder architectures.

An analysis of global trends has led NASA to identify three "Mega Trends" which will shape our aeronauti-
cal research plans during the coming years. First, global growth in demand for high-speed mobility reflects
rapid growth in demand for mobility and new modes of transportation. Second, affordability, sustainability,
and energy use presents severe challenges in balancing economy with environment. Third, technology con-
vergence points to convergence in sectors such as materials, manufacturing, energy, and information and
communication technologies that will transform aeronautical capabilities and air transportation options.
NASA organizes the aeronautics research portfolio around six Strategic Thrusts, prioritizing aeronautics
objectives in response to the above-mentioned Mega Trends and feedback from the aviation community.
The six Strategic Thrusts are safe, efficient growth; commercial supersonic aircraft; ultra-efficient subsonic
transport; safe, quiet, and affordable vertical lift air vehicles; in-time system-wide safety assurance; and
assured autonomy for aviation transportation.
NASA focuses its aeronautics research on high-risk, high-payoff research investments that will enable the
transformation of aviation to serve future needs, produce demonstrable benefits, and leverage technology
advances outside of, as well as within, traditional aviation disciplines. Major technology emphases include
electrified aircraft propulsion, low-sonic-boom supersonic flight, automation and autonomy, and fostering
new aviation applications in Advanced Air Mobility (AAM). Collectively, these efforts, other technologies, and
a focus on technology convergence will develop transformative solutions towards the ultimate goal of a
safe, efficient, adaptive, scalable, and environmentally sustainable global aviation system.
NASA uses an active process and seeks continuous feedback on its overall strategy as well as performance.
These efforts include: NASA Advisory Council (NAC) Aeronautics Committee reviews/reports; internal analy-
sis for budget formulation; inter-agency coordination with partners including FAA and DOD; Interaction with
international standard-setting groups such as ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization); roundtables
with subject matter experts convened by the National Academies; strategic planning efforts that include
trend analysis (which led to ARMD's Three Mega Trends); gap analysis (which led to ARMD's 6 Strategic
Thrusts); systems analysis by internal multi-center groups as well as ARMD-commissioned studies using
external analytical groups; OMB and Congressional directions from the appropriations process; and AIAA
(American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics) special conference sessions to obtain expert feedback.
Performance review efforts include: Annual program reviews for all ARMD projects, which include exter-
nal Independent Review Panels (IRPs) and Mission Directorate Reviews (four ARMD programs reporting
to the Associate Administrator every December); relevant Key Decision Point (KDP) or similar reviews that
occur for projects that within the scope of NASA Performance Requirements 7120.5 and 7120.8; Baseline

All four ARMD programs identified moderate to significant COVID-19 impacts. In the Advanced Air Vehicles
Program (AAVP), impacts were primarily related to availability of wind tunnel testing and other research
facilities at Ames Research Center, Glenn Research, and Langley Research Center and corresponding delays
to experimental research activities. In the Airspace Operations and Safety Program (AOSP), researchers
experienced dramatic reduction in air traffic volume resulting in lower availability of data and hardware/
software facilities. In the Integrated Aviation Systems Program (IASP), the Low Boom Flight Demonstration
(LBFD) project experienced manufacturing delays, many due to pandemic-related shutdowns. In the
Transformative Aeronautics Concepts Program (TACP) program, the University Innovation project identified
concerns with access to campus buildings and experimental facilities limiting ability of team members to
complete research on schedule. In addition, the Aerosciences Evaluation and Test Capabilities (AETC) Office
identified significant impacts to its 12 large wind tunnels and anticipated pandemic-related delays in main-
tenance activities, which would impact tunnel reliability for NASA and external customers. Within ARMD's
four programs and AETC, expenses continued to accrue even though most of our experimental facilities
were fully or partially shut down.
As of end of third quarter of FY 2021, 40 percent of ARMD's FY 2021 success measures were rated Yellow.
ARMD used reserves to recover and complete these measures by the end of FY 2021.
Highlights of ongoing critical efforts include:
Continuing work to complete final assembly of the aircraft for LBFD and deliver the aircraft for
community response flight testing in FY 2024. The community response data will be delivered to
ICAO, a United Nations specialized agency supporting diplomacy and cooperation in air transport,
to allow supersonic aircraft flight over land. LBFD recently completed its Delta KDP-D.
The Electrified Powertrain Flight Demonstration (EPFD) projectStarting Phase A formulation activi-
ties for the Electrified Powertrain Flight Demonstration project, which is focusing on flight demon-
strations that advance the state-of-the-art in megawatt-class electric aircrafts.
Completing system integration and verification and validation testing in preparation for flight test
of the X-57 Maxwell Mod Il electric aircraft.
Completing formulation activities for the Advance Air Mobility project; developing an initial Urban
Air Mobility airspace management system; and maturing System Concept, Architecture, and Book
of Requirements.
Closing out Airspace Technology Demonstration (ATD-1/2/3), Unmanned Aircraft Systems
Integration in the National Airspace System (UAS-NAS), Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic
Management (UTM), and Advanced Composites project activities and transferring the research
results to stakeholders such as RTCA, the Federal Aviation Administration, and Advanced
Composites Consortium.
Continuing formulation activities to develop hybrid thermally-efficient small core gas turbine
engines, ultra-efficient Transonic Truss-Braced Wing (TTBW) airplanes, and high-rate composite
aircraft manufacturing processes.
Continuing fundamental research and providing unique expertise and facilities to support com-
mercial hypersonic interests.

Johnny Stephenson, Associate Administrator, Office of Communications
NASA will inspire and engage the public and provide unique science, technology, engineering, and math
(STEM) opportunities for diverse audiences. By increasing public knowledge about NASA's work, the Agency
can contribute to science literacy and an improved national understanding and appreciation of the value
of STEM work and careers. The Agency also believes that it can help strengthen diversity in STEM fields by
ensuring that grantee universities comply with Federal requirements for minimizing and addressing issues
related to discrimination and harassment. NASA is employing a strategy that seeks to inspire, engage, edu-
cate, and employ the next generation of explorers through NASA-unique STEM learning opportunities. NASA
engages the public and students in its mission by providing authentic learning experiences with NASA's
people, content, and facilities; building a diverse future workforce; and contributing to exploration missions.
NASA's education and outreach functions each play a critical role in increasing public knowledge of NASA's
work, fostering an understanding and appreciation of the value of STEM, and enhancing opportunities to
teach and learn.
OCOMM serves as the corporate, Agency-wide communications function for NASA, providing a wide prac-
ticable and appropriate dissemination of information to news and media organizations and the general
public concerning the objectives, methods, and results of NASA programs. OCOMM connects people to
NASA's missions and accomplishments as we explore the unknown, enable technologies for improving life
on earth and inspire the world.

established communications enterprise management office is instituting business process improvements
that will better enable the enterprise to keep the public informed about NASA's activities. Other benefits of
the program include:
Increased coordination of Agency communications efforts and messaging in partnership
with Mission Directorates;
Expanded focus on strategic planning, integration, and budgeting process;
OCOMM budget aligned and monitored at a higher level, with increased planning and risk moni-
toring, and flexibility across functions and missions as needs change; and
Enhanced workforce agility across the enterprise, reduced single-point-failures, greater collabora-
tion across geographic boundaries.
NASA continues to integrate metrics and using data to inform decisions on better reaching the public,
engaging stakeholders and evaluate outcomes. The agency continues to use data to refine content and
social media distribution platforms, targeted to audience preferences.
Large, popular events and major activities, including the OSIRIS-REx Touch-and-Go event, NASA's SpaceX
Crew-1 launch and splashdown, Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich Satellite Launch, Green Run Hot Fire Test 1 and 2
(Artemis), Mars 2020 Perseverance Landing, Mars Ingenuity First Flight, Earth Day 2021, and Crew-2 Launch,
drove an increase in followers of our flagship digital accounts. Growth in social media across its flagship
accounts.
The Office of STEM Engagement (OSTEM) is enhancing the effectiveness of STEM engagement investments
using performance assessment and evaluation-driver processes, including the execution of a Learning
Agenda. The OSTEM Learning Agenda puts forth learning questions with associated sub-questions, learning
activities, and assessment methodologies, and learning products that will inform OSTEM's understanding of
the scope, methods, mechanisms, and outcomes from its investments. During 2020, OSTEM achieved 100
percent (3 of 3) of its Performance Goals and success criteria and executed four evidence-building activities
in support of its comprehensive performance assessment and evaluation strategy. OSTEM shared findings
and recommendations from learning activities, performance assessments, and evaluation activities with
internal and external stakeholders in order to make programmatic evidence-based decisions and updates to
the OSTEM Learning Agenda.
COVID-19 had an impact on the delivery of in-person STEM Engagement events, driving the need for OSTEM
to transition to implementation of virtual student engagement activities (NASA STEM @ Home Resources).
OSTEM implemented a risk-management strategy to ensure that all methods of participant engagement
were captured for the purposes of 2020 and beyond.
The Office of Diversity and Equal Opportunity (ODEO) began utilizing voluntary resolution agreements
to
ensure compliance with civil rights laws under which the Agency is undertaking compliance review and
assessment. In conducting a compliance assessment of Louisiana State University, ODEO determined the
university was in non-compliance with Title IX and, therefore, unable to provide equal opportunity regard-
less of sex in its educational programs. ODEO required Louisiana State University to sign a voluntary res-
olution agreement to come into compliance with Title IX, principally relating to appropriate resources to
conduct effective Title IX coordination and to ensure its Title IX procedures are prompt and equitable. In
addition, ODEO received confirmation from two other grantees on which it had conducted compliance
reviews under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. These
grantees, Science Museum of Minnesota and Virginia Air and Space Center, have undertaken 100 percent of
NASA compliance recommendations and corrective actions.

NASA is establishing appropriate partnerships to achieve the Agency's Mission using contracts to acquire
property or services and/or partnership agreements using other statutory authorities to implement mutu-
ally beneficial activities for NASA and its partner. The strategy for the success of this Strategic Objective
focuses on four areas: 1) Execute innovative, effective, and efficient procurement solutions and contracts
that enable NASA's mission; 2) Implement education and outreach to small businesses on how to part-
ner with NASA and its commercial partners; 3) Enable NASA's international and interagency partnerships
through management of agreements, engagements, guidance; and 4) Enable domestic, non-Federal part-
nerships that are strategic and beneficial for NASA through transparency, education, awareness, and out-
reach opportunities, and identify partnership resources and capabilities for the public.
The Office of Procurement (OP) has established a Closeout Capability Group with representatives from
across the Agency. This team provides a cohesive approach to closeout processes and procedures instead
of a Center-by-Center approach. As a result of the data analysis and closeout process oversight provided
by this team, OP now has a quarterly target of 1,500 contract closeouts and most recently surpassed the
quarterly target. OP has engaged with mission partners to jointly develop short-term procurement strate-
gies tailored to the 26 product service lines and begin the transition to long-term strategies. Sixteen product
service lines have transitioned to long-term strategies.
The Partnership Office is helping NASA expand our strategic non-procurement partnerships and meet
mission objectives by increasing the number of new partners with whom we do business. Our public "NASA
Partnerships" website and other outreach efforts are effective tools for accomplishing this objective. In FY

2021 (as of September 9, 2021), the Agency established partnerships with 107 new domestic, non-Federal
partners with whom we had not had previous agreements, and we established 59 new international agree-
ments.
The Office of Small Business Programs (OSBP) is meeting the percentage goal (as assigned by the Small
Business Administration) of dollars obligated to small businesses on both the prime and subcontracting
levels. OSBP also is refining the virtual outreach program.
The Office of International and Interagency Relations (OIIR) established a baseline of international partners
and identified 778 new international partnerships in FY 2020 and it projected establishing 720 new partner-
ships in FY 2021. COVID-19 closures have led to delays in the ability to meet milestones initially established
under some non-procurement partnership agreements. As a result, some existing partnership agreements
with both Federal and non-Federal partners have had to be extended, and in some cases, agreements were
terminated due to the inability to perform the work within the timeframe required by the partner.

(OFT) mission and is working to re-fly their uncrewed demonstration flight at the earliest opportunity.
NASA is successfully managing launch service capabilities across the civil space sector, and is managing
multiple NASA acquisitions, including the award of the Artemis Program Habitation and Logistics Outpost
(HALO) + Power and Propulsion Element (PPE) and a one-off contract for Europa Clipper. New contract
mechanisms are in development, including the award of new Venture Class acquisitions. The Launch
Services Program (LSP) managed two launches in FY 2021, with 10 advisory and 7 primary missions mani-
fested for launch in the next fiscal year. Four new commercial launch vehicle certifications are in progress in
FY 2021, and LSP is providing early insight into several emerging vehicles through multiple contract mecha-
nisms. LSP continues to support Commercial Resupply Services, Commercial Crew Program, and Artemis by
providing advisory expertise and contract awards while evaluating HLS requirements and staffing needs.
The Rocket Propulsion Test (RPT) program provided test services to internal and external customers
throughout FY 2021-most notably, the successful Space Launch System (SLS) Core Stage hot fire testing in
March. To date, the RPT program has provided 99.7 percent on-time delivery of 288 tests conducted across
multiple centers at the stage, engine, and component level under diverse test conditions. Artemis-related
activities that RPT supported included testing of the RS-25 engine, Orion risk reduction, and European
Service Module propulsion qualification testing. A significant level of demand from the commercial sector
was also supported. The RPT program continues to maintain a test capacity "right sized" approach to meet
Agency requirements; through strategically prioritized facility maintenance and modernization projects, RPT
infrastructure continues to perform well beyond their design lifetime.
Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) supported the Mars 2020 Perseverance rover landing,
Cygnus NG-15, Emirates Mars Mission Mars Orbit Insertion, and OSIRIS-REx asteroid sample collection, pro-
viding the communications services necessary to support all NASA robotic and Commercial Crew Program
missions. The Deep Space Network Aperture Enhancement Project (DAEP) in Madrid, Spain, went opera-
tional in FY 2021. The NASA networks continue to perform well above the 95 percent requirement and are
aligning upgrades and development activities with both the new SCaN Architecture Study and the Artemis
plans, with the initiation of the Commercial Services project.
The COVID operational environment has increased the risk of the RPT program's ability to address critical
maintenance and modernization projects. DAEP antenna work continued throughout FY 2021, with the oper-
ational staff in Spain available at a reduced level due to very high local pandemic levels of COVID-19.

heavily involved in COVID-19 planning and operations at the Agency level along with the White House.
Although no activities were dropped during FY 2021 due to the pandemic, and OCHMO was able to over-
see execution of human-rated and robotic missions, some activities have been delayed due to compet-
ing priorities. In addition, occupational health audits at Centers were delayed due to travel restrictions
and Center closures.
NASA's Technical Authorities increased awareness and reduced risk across the Agency through their

NASA formed the Talent Acquisition and Learning Office (TALO) to integrate all staffing services into a
central enterprise-level office to provide direction and leadership for more efficient and effective hiring
and development services. These changes in structure will work to address the increase in average time
to hire for FY 2020. In order to address this increase in time to hire, NASA has taken advantage of sev-
eral new hiring authorities and is migrating to the USAStaffing website. OCHCO is implementing process
changes to reduce the workload for hiring managers and hiring specialists. For example, increasing the
use of bundling hires allows multiple hires to be made from a single vacancy announcement, reducing
the time spent on the earlier stages of the hiring process. NASA continues to track and monitor hires to
ensure quality is not sacrificed for speed. We continue to have very high quality of hire ratings by man-
agers and high 2-year retention rates to support this.
In response to COVID-19 impacts, additional support has been given to supervisors to ensure they have
the skills and tools necessary to effectively manage their workforce through an uncertain and stress-
ful time in a virtual environment. This includes training on managing a virtual workforce and providing
directions on how to best utilize available collaboration tools. New processes have been implemented
to shift to virtual on-boarding/off-boarding, which allowed for employees to onboard without having to
physically visit a Center.
NASA has made progress in implementing strategies focused on creating an inclusive environment
for all employees to feel engaged and safe to raise concerns. NASA has established a Diversity, Equity,
and Inclusion Steering Committee (DEISC), which will be formulating and implementing Administration
DEI initiatives through a DEISC Action Plan for the Agency. NASA has also established the DEI Strategic
Partnership composed of the DEISC Members, officials in charge, and representatives from all Employee
Resource Groups to socialize and refine our initiatives and share best practices. We took initial steps in
implementation of Executive Order (EO) 13985, Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved
Communities Through the Federal Government, which revokes EO 13950. NASA issued a revocation of
policy related to EO 13950 as it applied to NASA and its contractors. We are implementing an Agency
Unity Campaign, which has resulted in NASA highlighting "Inclusion" as an Agency Core Value; imple-
mentation of a new Diversity, Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO), and Unity requirement for all
Senior Executive Service performance plans, with work underway on a similar requirement for manag-

an annual unfunded maintenance liability of approximately $130 million to sustain our infrastructure,
coupled with 80 percent of our facilities beyond their useful life, compounds the growing deferred main-
tenance backlog (currently $2.66 billion). This increases mission risk. Categorizing assets by MDI versus
FCI will help NASA invest limited resources in the most mission critical assets.
We continue to demolish facilities with low MDI and low FCI, resulting in 51 facilities demolished in FY
2020, surpassing the target of 20 facilities. NASA's mid-term goal is to use this information to inform
repair and renewal investments, maintenance prioritization through a tiered maintenance system, and
leverage condition-based maintenance and reliability-centered maintenance. NASA continues to seek
and implement courses of action to strategically mitigate risks and leverage opportunities. Nonetheless,
investment in construction, renewal/revitalization, and maintenance of facilities is essential to ensure
ready and reliable facilities to support mission requirements.
NASA has identified and quantified energy use in types/classes of facilities that are significant energy
users. While exceeding statutory energy and water reduction goals (reducing energy use intensity in
buildings subject to the goals by more than 43 percent in FY 2020, compared to the 2003 baseline, and
reducing water use intensity over 33 percent, compared to the 2007 baseline), achieving continual year-
over-year reductions, has become increasingly challenging. In order to meet this challenge, the Agency
analyzed significant energy users that have not traditionally been included in energy conservation mea-
sures analyses due to their unique mission applications and identified and prioritized energy and water
consumption reduction opportunities.
