Treasury FY 2022-2026 Capacity Assessment
Executive Summary
Background
The Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018 ("Evidence Act") requires agencies to
assess current agency capacity for planning and implementing evidence-building activities (a "capacity
assessment"). Done every four years as part of the strategic planning process, the assessment must
consider the characteristics of coverage, quality, methods, effectiveness, and independence across four
types of evidence-building activities: statistics, evaluation, research, and analysis.
Treasury's capacity assessment aims to (1) understand how the Department currently builds evidence
and (2) assess the Department's capacity for conducting necessary evidence-building activities, where
capacity includes infrastructure (processes, data, etc.) and staffing (resource levels and skill). For this
first-ever baseline capacity assessment, we analyzed existing and readily available data on current
evidence-building activities and capabilities within Treasury bureaus and offices, including internal
surveys, external surveys, bureau self-assessments as of August 2021, and strategic planning discussions
during 2022. Treasury plans to use this baseline assessment to prioritize opportunities to increase
capacity and mature practices across the enterprise. See Appendix A for definitions and methodology.
Overall Assessment of Treasury's Capacity
Adapted from OMB guidance, Treasury identified three elements indicative of the maturity of an
agency's evidence-building capacity: the maturity of an agency's learning culture, the maturity of the
processes for producing and executing the agency's key evidence-building prioritization tools (the
Learning Agenda and evaluation plan), and the existence, quality, and adoption of an agency's
evaluation policy. We used these to develop a preliminary framework for summarizing our findings by
maturity level, with the lowest maturity being Level 1 (Launch/Initial), then Level 2
(Repeatable/Defined); and with the highest level of maturity being Level 3 (Managed/Optimized). We
intend to test and refine this maturity model over time.

Treasury FY 2022-2026 Capacity Assessment
Recommended Actions
Based on the findings of the baseline capacity assessment, Treasury will seek to implement the following
recommended actions as soon as practicable.
1. Enable more sophisticated analysis in future iterations of the capacity assessment:
Improve identification of the evidence-building workforce within Treasury and benchmark
current skill levels for this workforce
Leverage the Department's Integrated Talent Management system to identify skills gaps and
developmental needs pertaining to evidence-building, including for program and project
managers
Better leverage budget, financial, and procurement data to gain insight into resources spent on
evidence-building activities; identify opportunities to improve the data (e.g., refining and
standardizing definitions of evidence-building related activities) to track funding and execution
levels
2.
Define and strengthen an evidence-building culture Department-wide:
Establish a common lexicon for data and evidence building
Create a Treasury evaluation or evidence-building community with designated points of contact
for each bureau who will share responsibility for planning and executing Treasury's learning
agenda and implementing Treasury's evidence building policy (when finalized)
Refine and test a maturity model for evidence-building capacity to determine leading practices
and growth areas across Treasury
3. Implement evidence-related Critical Management Initiatives from the Treasury Strategic Plan,
which can be summarized into five key themes:
Increase agency capacity for evidence-building disciplines
Increase level of data literacy for all staff
Mature data governance and standards
Enable and improve data monitoring and reporting technologies, aiming for real-time and near
real-time analysis and use of data in decision-making
Secure and modernize IT systems, enhancing collaboration with internal and external partners
Identify and increase access to datasets and databases
4. Develop and implement a Department-wide evidence policy, inclusive of an evaluation policy.
Dedicate resources and staff capacity for policy development and implementation
Rationalize with existing guidelines on performance measurement and reporting, data quality,
and strategic planning

Treasury FY 2022-2026 Capacity Assessment
Detailed Findings
For this baseline capacity assessment, we analyzed existing and readily available data on current
evidence-building activities and capabilities within Treasury bureaus and offices, including internal
surveys, external surveys, bureau self-assessments as of August 2021, and strategic planning discussions
during 2022. Treasury plans to use this baseline assessment to prioritize opportunities to increase
capacity and mature practices across the enterprise. See Appendix A for definitions and methodology.
Key Findings by Characteristic
Coverage and Methods: The baseline assessment showed that all four types of evidence-building
activities are being used at least to some extent by Treasury's bureaus and offices (see Detailed
Findings: Coverage and Methods). Of note, the Department's most frequently employed type of
evidence-building is analysis (41.5% of bureaus/offices use analysis at least to some extent), and the
evidence-building activities least used are statistics (13%) and evaluations (19%). However, the
assessment revealed two points that suggest clarifications and outreach are needed to more precisely
estimate the current distribution of evidence-building activities being performed in Treasury:
(1) There is no consistent understanding of the definitions of evidence-building activities, and
(2) Bureau and offices found it difficult to estimate resources (positions and funding) devoted to
evidence activities.
Treasury bureaus with dedicated analysis and/or research staff have mature evidence-building
methodologies. For example, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Office of Economic Policy, and the
Office of Tax Policy have mature capabilities in research and statistics, though other parts of Treasury
have limited or no resources devoted to research, evaluation, or statistics. Use of program evaluations
to improve impact and implementation of Treasury programs is a growth area. Treasury is not currently
able to further assess use of appropriate methodologies within each evidence-building type.
Effectiveness: Managers and members of the performance community who responded to recent
surveys identified the use of evidence in decision-making as an agency-wide area of opportunity (see
Appendix A). However, through the strategic planning engagements, stakeholders repeatedly identified
challenges in hiring for data skills and identified a need to train the current workforce to use data to
better support the Department's learning and decision-making. Further, Treasury does not currently
have dedicated resources at the enterprise level for assessing and growing capacity across the
Department. Also, the lack of an Evidence policy (inclusive of an evaluation policy) limits the
Department's ability to consistently apply standards throughout a defined evidence-building lifecycle
(i.e., from evidence collection, analysis, dissemination, integration to decision making). (See Detailed
Findings: Effectiveness)
Quality: Through strategic planning engagements, stakeholders repeatedly identified data sharing
challenges that create barriers for data use and collaboration (inside and outside of the Department)
and limit the quality of data used for decision-making and in evidence-building activities. Further,
stakeholders expressed challenges for data collection and meeting the demand for data use in new
policy areas, such as climate, equity, and in new congressionally mandated programs. Historical internal
surveys have also indicated room for improvement in perceptions of the quality and availability of data
for decision-making, although it has improved over time.
4
Treasury FY 2022-2026 Capacity Assessment
Independence: Treasury has internal controls and oversight mechanisms in place to ensure certain types
of activities, such as performance reporting or statistical activities that are carried out free from bias and
inappropriate influence. For example, the IRS's Statistics of Income (SOI) division produces official
statistics in adherence with OMB Statistical Policy Directive #1. Though, without an established
Evaluation Policy (currently in development), Treasury does not yet have standards in place to more
broadly assess this characteristic of the Department's capacity to build evidence.
Detailed Findings: Coverage and Methods
To understand the methods and coverage of evidence-building activities employed by bureaus, Treasury
asked bureaus and offices to self-assess their current activities and use of evidence. Operating bureaus¹
were asked to identify an initial list of ongoing and planned evidence-building activities (Appendix B).
Operating bureaus were also asked to describe and estimate the labor and non-labor resources devoted
to each type of evidence-building activity, and the share of total evidence building resources devoted to
each type of activity (e.g., 30% research, 20% statistics, 40% analysis, 10% evaluation).

In reviewing bureau submissions, the Evaluation Officer staff noted that despite having defined each
type of evidence-building activity in the report instructions, bureaus and offices lack a consistent
understanding of these definitions. Bureaus assessed higher levels of evaluation and statistical activities
than expected. All of Treasury's operating bureaus cited performance measurement as one of its
analysis activities, which is consistent with the Department's expectation based on the maturity of the
Department's organizational performance framework. Treasury bureaus have varying levels of maturity
with respect to coordinating and implementing research activities and evaluations, with the IRS having
the largest dedicated capacity across all four types of activities.
1 For the purposes of this Capacity Assessment, operating bureaus are as follows: Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and
Trade Bureau (TTB), Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP), Bureau of the Fiscal Service (Fiscal), Financial Crimes
Enforcement Network (FinCEN), International Revenue Service (IRS), U.S. Mint (Mint), Office of the Comptroller of
the Currency (OCC), and Departmental Offices (DO). Inspectors General are not included in this assessment.

Treasury FY 2022-2026 Capacity Assessment
Table 1 (below) aggregates the bureau and office self-assessments based on how they align to
Treasury's FY 2022-2026 Strategic Objectives to give a sense of enterprise capacity across Treasury's
strategic priorities. Through this exercise, Treasury's operating bureaus indicated a limited ability to
estimate the extent to which resources are devoted to each type of evidence-building activity. There is
also limited understanding of the targeted level of activity needed, making it difficult to identify specific
areas that are under-resourced within the Department.

Treasury FY 2022-2026 Capacity Assessment
Treasury will aim to improve the precision of this analysis in future iterations of the capacity assessment
and plans to deepen the analysis to better understand capacity to address learning agenda questions
aligned to the objectives. Achieving this will require continued focus on the Department's current plans
to mature data governance and increase timely access to and use of quality data and evidence, which
are articulated in Treasury's strategic objective 5.3: Better Use of Data. Treasury recognizes that it has
yet to implement certain elements of all three titles of the Evidence Act, including the establishment of
department data and quality standards, evaluation policy, data sharing, open data, annual reporting,
and standard researcher application requirements. Furthermore, while Treasury has mature
performance management and analysis capabilities across the enterprise, Treasury has minimal capacity
to assist program offices and bureau staff in developing their capacity to use evaluation and research
approaches in day-to-day operations.
As lead for Objective 5.3, Treasury's Chief Data Officer (CDO) will work with the Data Governance Board
to strengthen data governance at the enterprise-level and integrate data standards with the
Department's evaluation policy. These efforts will enhance the Evaluation Officer's ability to assess the
rigor and appropriateness of methods used to generate evidence and will increase employee confidence
in the quality of data. The CDO will also work with the Data Advisory Council (DAC), comprised of bureau
CDOs and other relevant stakeholders and representatives, to ensure that enterprise data governance
incorporates the key takeaways of Treasury's Data Maturity Assessment and provides opportunities for
maturing bureau-level data standards and skills and strengthening data sharing between components.
Detailed Findings: Effectiveness
The assessment indicated that bureaus and offices find great utility in their evidence-building activities
and products. The analysis revealed that:
(1) All bureaus and offices use their evidence-building activities/products for internal policy
making and internal strategic management processes decision making.
(2) 5 of 7 bureaus shared that their research data is used by external government partners.
(3) 4 of 7 bureaus indicated that in addition to internal decision making and use by external
government partners, analysis products are used by external non-government partners.
However, coupled with feedback from the strategic planning engagement, the assessment revealed
existing challenges that may hinder effective evidence use. To better understand these challenges, the
Deputy Performance Improvement Officer/Evaluation Officer worked with bureaus and offices, the
Deputy Assistant Secretary for Human Resources and Chief Human Capital Officer (DASHR-CHCO), Chief
Data Officer (CDO), and Chief Information Officer (CIO), to identify critical gaps in human capital,
information technology, and data infrastructure that create barriers to effective use of evidence.
The critical management initiatives listed below, by strategic goal, identify the gaps in human capital,
data, and information technology (IT) infrastructure that currently limit the agency's capacity for
evidence-building. These can be summarized into five themes:
Increase staff capacity and literacy
Mature data governance and standards
Enable and improve data monitoring and reporting technologies, aiming for real-time and near
real-time analysis and use of data in decision-making
Secure and modernize IT systems, enhancing collaboration with internal and external partners
Identify and increase access to datasets and databases

Treasury FY 2022-2026 Capacity Assessment
Appendix A: Methodology and Data Sources
Guiding Questions
The Data Governance Board² participated in this baseline assessment, which was then reviewed by
performance contacts in Treasury bureaus and offices. Treasury assessed the agency's capacity to build
evidence across the four evidence-building activity types by attempting to answer the following
questions for each required characteristic:
Coverage: What are each bureau and office's ongoing and planned statistics, evaluation, research,
and analysis activities? What are the associated resource levels for these activities and how is the
resulting evidence used?
Quality: Are the data we generate and collect high in quality with respect to utility, objectivity, and
integrity?
Methods: What methods are being used for evidence-building activities? Are they rigorous and
appropriate?
Effectiveness: Are evidence-building activities meeting their intended outcomes, including serving
the needs of stakeholders, and being disseminated? Does the agency have processes, procedures,
and trained staff in place to use the findings to support agency learning, improvement, and decision-
making?
Independence: To what extent are evidence-building activities free from bias and inappropriate
influence?
Data Sources
Bureau and Office Self-Assessment: See Appendix B.
FY 2022-2026 Strategic Plan Stakeholder Engagement: Leveraging the FY 2022-2026 Strategic Plan
development process during FY 2021, the Department conducted nine strategic planning discussions
(involving over 200 Treasury leaders) to develop an initial set of draft strategic goals and objectives.
As leaders and staff continued to refine the strategic plan in later months, stakeholders were asked
to identify "critical management initiatives (CMIs)", which are management support initiatives
needed to enable objective and mission success. Specifically, these CMIs are in the areas of human
capital, data, and information technology (IT). The capacity assessment captured those CMIs directly
relating to specific evidence-building related strategies and provided analysis to identify the most
pressing areas that hindered the Department's ability to execute its priorities. Learning Agenda
questions were also identified during this process and informed discussion of critical management
initiatives.
2 The Data Governance Board is chaired by the Chief Data Officer and includes the Evaluation Officer, the Statistical
Official, the Associate Chief Information Officer for Enterprise Business Solutions, the Deputy Chief Financial
Officer, and the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Privacy, Transparency, and Records.

Treasury FY 2022-2026 Capacity Assessment
Management Surveys: For this baseline assessment, Treasury analyzed certain questions from the
FY 2017 Government Accountability Office (GAO) Managers' Survey³ to gain insights into Treasury
managers' perceptions of evidence-building capacity. Treasury also reviewed the FY 2020 GAO
Managers' Survey, which included additional questions about program evaluations and evidence-
building activities. However, staff found inconsistencies when attempting to validate this data
against other sources, including internal surveys and information provided in the self-assessment.
For example, over 30 percent of managers responded that evaluations were conducted in alignment
to an agency evaluation plan and an agency evaluation policy, while Treasury and most bureaus did
not have an established evaluation plan or policy at the time of the survey.
Furthermore, the lack of comparability between the 2017 and 2020 surveys made it difficult to
determine whether managers were applying consistent definitions. Additionally, because of the
number of managers within the IRS, the survey data is skewed toward the IRS experience. Due to
these concerns and varying interpretations of key terms across Treasury, staff determined this was
not an appropriate representation of the Department's evidence capacity.
The Deputy Performance Improvement Officer and Budget Officer also conduct a joint internal
annual survey of organizational performance and budget officials, which provides some insight into
trust and confidence in the availability and use of data (see Table 2). In FY 2016, Treasury
implemented a data quality improvement plan that may account for the high perception of
confidence across certain stakeholder groups in FY 2016 and 2017. Limitations of this data include a
small and varying survey population and reliance on subjective information, which makes the results
hard to interpret. Treasury is currently exploring how to improve this survey instrument to make
results more actionable.
