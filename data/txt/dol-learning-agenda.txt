Foreword
How can the Department of Labor (DOL) train vulnerable workers on health and safety practices to
reduce workplace injuries? What are the policies that could support gainful employment for young
adults with developmental disabilities? How can the Department of Labor encourage more participation
in apprenticeships, especially among women workers of color? And can partnerships between the
Department of Labor, state governments, and community-based organizations help expand access to
unemployment insurance among eligible workers?
These are just a few of the research questions that DOL agencies plan to study over the next four years as
summarized in our FY 2022-2026 Evidence Building Plan. The breadth of these questions-representing
contributions from sixteen DOL agencies-affirms - DOL's commitment to integrating evidence into agency
functions, including policy development, budget and strategic planning, program administration, and
performance management. These projects also highlight the close alignment between the department's
evidence-building activities and the short, medium, and long-run objectives of each individual agency, the
department as a whole, and the Biden-Harris Administration.
An especially important priority in preparing this plan has been meeting the groundbreaking charge
issued to all federal agencies in Executive Order 13985. That Executive Order asks agencies to assess
how federal programs, policies, and contracting opportunities reach historically excluded or marginalized
communities, including people of color, women and persons with disabilities, and then to take steps to
advance greater inclusion of those populations.
At the Department of Labor, we have already embarked on a number of activities in service of this charge,
and this Evidence-Building Plan represents a particularly integral contribution. We need high-quality, timely
evidence to first establish which populations may be excluded from departmental initiatives and benefits;
to formulate policy shifts targeting activities, resources, and interventions to populations in need; and
finally, to investigate whether and how those interventions meaningfully change the material conditions of
underserved communities.
Taken together, the projects detailed in this plan speak to each step of the evidence-to policy lifecycle,
thereby helping the Department of Labor deliver its programs and resources, and benefits more equitably
to all workers.

Summary
The Department of Labor's Evidence-Building Plan is a project-based learning roadmap, describing over
40 new activities to generate credible information in response to important short- and long-term strategic
and operational questions. Credible information, or evidence, may stem from program evaluations,
foundational fact-finding or research, policy analyses, or performance data. The Evidence-Building Plan is
the cumulative product of each DOL agency's individual learning agenda, a prioritization process to identify
information they need to know in order to achieve their agency and departmental mission. Sixteen DOL
agencies have contributed to this document, coordinated by DOL's Chief Evaluation Office in consultation
with the department's four Evidence Officials.
Evidence-building activities that DOL will conduct in Fiscal Years 2022-2026 are focused on DOL's five
Priority Learning Areas: improving equity in employment and training programs, reducing barriers to
women's employment, studying the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, improving enforcement activities
and protections for all, and strengthening unemployment to reemployment. In addition, the department
commits to a number of cross-cutting activities to improve capacity to develop, access, understand and use
evidence. Lastly, the department outlines potential topics for future evidence-building activities.

I. What is the Evidence-Building Plan
and Who Should Use It?
The Evidence-Building Plan, also referred to as a "learning agenda" by Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) Memorandum M-19-23, is a systematic plan for identifying and addressing priority questions relevant to
improving the programs, policies, and regulations of the Department of Labor (department or DOL). The plan
identifies and prioritizes strategies to develop credible information to answer important short- and long-term
strategic and operational questions.
All of the department's evidence documents, including the Evidence-Building Plan, Evaluation Plan, and
Evidence Capacity Assessment, are developed collaboratively with the internal agency stakeholders,
departmental leadership, and the department's Evidence Officials. Each internal agency develops individual
learning agendas, which roll up to the department's evidence documents. These subcomponent learning
agendas and processes provide an infrastructure to customize and monitor their own learning roadmaps, in
addition to contributing to the broader departmental strategic mission.
Across the department, these evidence documents are useful in helping to:
Build upon and scale prior successes, as well as for continuous improvement of
DOL practices, policies, and programs;
Identify new questions to advance understanding;
Innovate and develop data-informed approaches to answer priority questions;
Seek opportunities to coordinate evidence-building activities across the department
and other federal agencies;
Monitor and assess progress along complex and multidimensional learning goals; and
Communicate to Congress, state and local partners, grantees, and the public about
new and ongoing areas of investment for data-informed insights.

Defining Evidence
OMB defines evidence as the available body of facts or information indicating whether a belief or proposition is
true or valid. Evidence can be quantitative or qualitative and may come from a variety of sources. There are four
types of evidence-building activities included in this plan, which align with the four interdependent components
of evidence identified in OMB Memorandum M-19-23:
Policy Analysis. Analysis of data, such as
Performance Management. Development,
general purpose surveys or program-specific
analysis, and reporting of performance
data, to generate and inform policy (e.g.,
measures and milestones related to the
estimating regulatory impacts and other
achievement of strategic goals and objectives.

Scope and Coverage of Activities in this Plan
DOL's Evidence-Building Plan provides key priority learning areas and corresponding activities planned for
initiation during the same four-year time period as the department's strategic planning cycle for FY 2022-FY 2026.
This planning document will remain iterative in its development, with annual refinements.
The department's mission is broad and diverse, touching the lives of unemployed, underemployed and working
individuals, retirees, employers, and organizations that support employment, workforce information, training,
security, benefits, and hiring and working conditions. Everything we do is based on a worker-centered vision for
the department to empower all workers morning, noon and night. The agencies collectively working toward that
vision through the activities in this plan are as follows:
Bureau of International Labor Affairs
Office of Labor-Management

Evidence Officials at the U.S. Department of Labor
The department's evidence-building capabilities span performance measurement, statistics, policy analysis,
data governance, and program evaluation. With the passage of the Foundations for Evidence-Based
Policymaking Act of 2018 (Evidence Act), the leadership roles overseeing those functions have been codified.
The department's Evidence Officials guide efforts to build and use credible information at a departmental level,
working in partnership with counterparts across the department and other federal agencies, with the goal of
informing the policies and programs that improve the lives and safety of American workers. Although each
Evidence Official has a distinct role, all support the development and use of the data the department needs to
advance its mission, strategic goals, and priorities.
Chief Evaluation Officer
The Chief Evaluation Officer coordinates, manages, and implements the department's evaluation research
program and leads the Chief Evaluation Office (CEO) in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Policy. CEO
works closely with the department's agencies to conduct independent evaluation research and other rigorous
data analyses that address priorities set by the Secretary and the agencies. The Chief Evaluation Officer is
responsible for guiding the department's learning agenda, annual evaluation plan, and research capacity
assessment; directing the department's Data Analytics Unit; overseeing the department's Evaluation Policy that
governs this research; and coordinating the development of this Evidence-Building Plan. The Chief Evaluation
Officer is Dr. Christina Yancey.
Chief Data Officer
The Chief Data Officer (CDO) in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Policy is responsible for data
governance and lifecycle data management, and supporting the department in meeting the requirements of
the Federal Data Strategy and Open Government Data Act. The CDO serves as chairman of the DOL Data
Board, a departmental work group charged with leading efforts to improve the department's data management
processes, ensure that data are fit for purpose, increase capacity to leverage data as a strategic asset, develop
and guide data strategy, management, and policy, work with the Chief Information Officer to align infrastructure
with mission and to support more optimal data governance, stewardship, architecture, and use. The Chief Data
Officer is Scott Gibbons.

In addition to this broad-based engagement, the department convened an 11-member panel of highly-qualified
experts in the workforce development field, including representatives from workforce boards, academics,
nonprofit organizations that partner with or study the workforce system, and labor unions. The panel provided
DOL with targeted input on high-priority research topics related to WIOA programs and services that could build
on the current evidence base, fill key knowledge gaps, and could be potentially suitable for rigorous evaluation.
A summary of the findings from these engagements is available on the department's website.²
Frequently raised topics during these engagements included: work-based learning and apprenticeships; career
pathways, advancement, and stackable credentials; integrated services and co-enrollment; employer services
and engagement; career planning and navigation; remote work and remote services; COVID-19-related job
changes; changes in the value of credentials; data infrastructure; and diversity, equity, and inclusion in the
workforce training system and the world of work. Many key knowledge gaps and research needs for the
workforce system raised by these stakeholders were considered for and are reflected in the evidence-building
activities included in this plan.
Ongoing and Future Stakeholder Engagement
On July 8, 2021, DOL published and subsequently disseminated to DOL's half-million Twitter followers an
invitation for public comment on the department's strategic planning activities, including the five priority learning
areas included in this plan (see Figure 2 next page). The invitation was published in English and Spanish, with
a deadline of August 6, 2021, for public comment.
On July 29, 2021, DOL's Office of Congressional and Intergovernmental Affairs sponsored a Congressional
outreach session. This session included a high-level briefing by the department on its strategic planning
approach, including the five priority learning areas within this plan. Further, it allowed Congressional aids from
both appropriations and authorizations to ask questions and to provide direct comment.
After February 2022, the department will engage in further targeted stakeholder feedback, to support ongoing
evidence development and dissemination activity. As the Evidence-Building Plan is an evolving document, the
department anticipates refining activities based on future stakeholder inputs. DOL is especially interested in
ensuring perspectives from a diverse array of stakeholders who represent the communities our programs serve.

III. Planned Evidence-Building Activities
by Priority Learning Area
This report describes DOL's planned evidence-building activities in three sections. This section describes the
five Priority Learning Areas that the department will explore, as well as specific time-bound projects DOL intends
to initiate that address each of the Priority Learning Areas. The next section (Section IV) describes overarching
initiatives DOL plans to carry out during FY 2022-2026 that touch on many different themes and topics relevant
to DOL's mission. The last section (Section V), describes future research topics that are of interest to the
department that may inform DOL's future evidence-building commitments going forward.
A cross-cutting theme for all of these learning areas is the need to improve equity in access to, and participation
in, DOL programs, benefits, and protections, reflecting the department's commitment to fulfilling the charge set
out by this administration's focus on equity for underserved communities. Further, these initial offerings were
co-developed with the department's strategic plan and will be updated as DOL continues to advance learning
across its strategies and activities.
DOL has identified five Priority Learning Areas
for this plan, as described in Figure 2. In the

no existing payroll codes for those using this leave; this data only started being
reported with routine codes more than six months after implementation. There
are also data quality issues within the payroll data, as agencies use differing
payroll systems and approaches and do not have a consistent data cleaning
procedure. To address this, we are proactively reviewing and cleaning FEPLA
and leave data, while also working to improve the overall quality of payroll data.
2. Selecting the appropriate time period for comparison. For comparisons of before
and after implementation of FEPLA, there are complicating factors regarding time
periods for comparison, including the lack of payroll codes and the COVID-19
pandemic, which is anticipated to have an effect on childbearing and leave taking
patterns. As such, we will carefully consider the appropriate time periods for both
before and after comparison and will interpret findings with caution.

IV. Cross-Cutting Evidence Building Activities
DOL Scholars Program
The department will engage the academic community in efforts to build evidence on labor issues of
importance to the department through DOL's Research Scholars and Grants program. 4 Launched in 2012 by
the Chief Evaluation Office, this program builds the capacity of university-based researchers, and particularly
emerging scholars, to rigorously examine labor-related issues while improving awareness and understanding of
these issues among program administrators, policy makers, and the public. CEO will work with DOL leadership
and DOL agencies to select priority research topics for future rounds of DOL Scholars grants. DOL has
identified an initial list of topics that may be of interest to explore via DOL Scholars grants or the Data Challenge
for Emerging Scholars & Academics program described below. Potential priority research topics for these
grants can be found in the final section of this report (Section V).
Data Challenge for Emerging Scholars & Academics
In March 2021, CEO launched DOL's first Summer Data Equity Challenge5 competition, resulting in five
awards. This program differs from DOL Scholars in its eligibility requirements, outputs, and timeline. The Summer
Data Challenge requires research teams to include at least one emerging researcher as author or co-author
(defined as a current Ph.D. candidate or researcher who completed their Ph.D. no more than five years prior).
Research teams may also include established academics (researchers who received their Ph.D. more than five
years prior) as long as the research is co-authored with an emerging researcher. DOL intends to conduct the
Summer Data Equity Challenge as an annual grant competition.
The purpose of the Summer Data Challenge is to support rigorous research using public data, including DOL
data, or other administrative data to examine how well DOL policies, protections, and programs serve traditionally
underserved communities due to race, gender identity, sexual orientation, ethnicity, income, geography, immigrant
status, veteran and disability status, or other factors proposed by the applicant. Conducted on a faster timeline
than the Scholars program, the Summer Data Challenge is intended to provide faster-turnaround insights and
data that can inform specific DOL programs.

Increasing Diversity Among DOL-Funded Research Partners
DOL is currently identifying ways it can support researchers and organizations representing
traditionally underrepresented groups in accessing and applying for research opportunities sponsored
by DOL. To this end, CEO is currently developing a partnership with the Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) to conduct research projects through its Historically Black Colleges and Universities
(HBCU) Research Centers of Excellence initiative. 6 Given the close association between housing, community
development, and labor-related issues, DOL will seek to partner with HUD to conduct innovative research on
topics relevant to housing and labor through these centers. The research projects will focus on priority topics of
interest to the department related to underserved communities and historically marginalized populations.

Clearinghouse for Labor Evaluation and Research (CLEAR)
CLEAR (clear.dol.gov) helps make research on labor topics more accessible to practitioners,
policymakers, researchers, and the public to inform labor-related decision-making.
During FY 2022-2026, CLEAR will continue to produce different types of systematic evidence reviews to
identify, evaluate, and summarize findings from all relevant individual studies in a particular evidence base in an
accessible manner. These reviews primarily examine causal evidence, which sheds light on what interventions or
strategies are most effective, while also providing information about the size of the evidence base and where gaps
exist. Systematic reviews that also examine qualitative studies can answer questions about how those interventions
work, facilitating the possibility of replication or scaling. These types of reviews can be structured around topic areas
or dates. Systematic reviews driven by dates allow CLEAR to include the most up-to-date literature on a variety of
labor topics of interest to DOL, regardless of the size of the evidence base. Other types of reviews - such as rapid
evidence reviews - can help address time-constrained questions. Rapid reviews quickly summarize evidence on
relevant programs and potentially promising strategies to support evidence-based decision-making in response to
pressing labor issues, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
In FY 2022, CLEAR will begin to address a variety of research questions of interest to DOL agencies through its
evidence reviews, anticipating beginning up to 4 new evidence reviews in FY 2022 of interest across DOL agencies.
Topic areas may include reemployment programs and retraining/reemploying workers as part of a transition to a
sustainable energy economy; effective practices for securing employer compliance with workplace protections; and
effects of paid leave policies on workers' employment and earnings.
CLEAR routinely conducts briefings and develops short syntheses upon completion of its evidence reviews
for DOL staff, to support their ability to understand and use the results of the reviews to make evidence-based
decisions. CLEAR is currently exploring how to build on past dissemination approaches to continue to support
evidence-based decision-making, increase capacity to consume evidence, and refine or develop new types of
relevant syntheses and dissemination approaches.

DOL Staff Capacity Building: Evaluation, Measurement,
and Analytics Training Program
CEO is developing a training program to increase the capacity of DOL staff to generate, evaluate,
assess, and use labor-related evidence. The training will include detailed courses on the introduction and
application of concepts related to program evaluation and data analytics, resulting in certifications for DOL staff
who have completed the program. The development of the curriculum is still underway and has been informed
by findings from the DOL Evidence Capacity Assessment, including results from a DOL staff survey about use
and knowledge of evidence-related topics, as well as staff focus groups.
Improved Measurement & Data Collection of Key Constructs
BLS, CEO, and several DOL sub-agencies plan to conduct activities during FY 2022-2026 to improve the way
certain key labor concepts are measured, ultimately improving the quality of data available about these topics.
DOL plans to conduct at least four initiatives of this type, as described below.
Review of Consumer Price Index (CPI) Measures
BLS frequently contracts with the independent Committee on National Statistics (CNSTAT), a branch of
the National Academy of Sciences, to examine new sources of data and improvements to processes.
Currently, CNSTAT is reviewing the BLS Consumer Price Index to evaluate whether to take explicit steps to
mitigate upper-level substitution bias, as well as best methods for estimating price change for complex topics,
such as health insurance, owner-occupied housing, and durables. Separate from the CNStat review, BLS is
exploring options for providing additional CPI indexes for sub-populations, including perhaps different income
categories. As work in these areas continues, BLS will focus on testing, including focus groups, field testing,
and other options to determine how best to implement change. Other work will be needed on systems, statistical
methods, publication review, implications for data collection, and other aspects of the CPI process. Such work
may provide evidence that can be helpful in ongoing equity-related policy discussions. Throughout FY 22-26, BLS
expects to explore and potentially modify its current CPI processes to construct its indexes, possibly blending
traditionally collected data with alternatively collected and sourced data.

Improving Foundational Knowledge of Care Economy Workers
In FY 2022 and beyond, ODEP expects to work with BLS, CEO, and internal and external stakeholders, to
assess how federal data collections can better identify workers in caregiving professions, including workers
who provide homebased or community-based care to others. Caregiving workers are not always identified in
existing federal datasets that provide occupational information. Improving and standardizing the way caregiving
occupations are measured in data collections is a necessary step toward improving foundational knowledge
about these workers.

Improving DOL's Data Infrastructure
DOL continues to make significant strides to improve data infrastructure in ways that bring significant
value to internal and external users. These efforts are intended to make access to data more efficient and
effective, and to ensure that data are fit for purpose, interoperable, comprehensible, and have utility for the
widest possible set of users and uses. These efforts have benefited from active cooperating and coordination
between the Chief Data Officer, Chief Information Officer, Evidence Officials, and the agency staff comprising
DOL's Data Board. While some of this work involves technology, much of it involves culture change, and
success will depend on closely aligning the proposed activities with Agency mission, existing and prospective
departmental needs, and demonstrable value for all stakeholders.
Improved Access to Data
DOL has created a new consolidated data portal and Application Programming Interface (API) that provides on
demand access to machine-readable data. The new data portal and API should give Federal, private and public
data users outside the department easier ways to find DOL data, as well as simple, consistent, and repeatable
methods to access data that integrate well with research, analysis and reporting functions. These services have
gone live within the department and the service is being evaluated for its adoption and customer experience,
and the ways in which agencies integrate the service into their operations to inform decisions about opening it
up to the public. The goal of this work is to expand the convenience and functionality with which DOL data can
be leveraged by researchers and members of the public.

Data Governance
DOL has been actively working to expand data management and governance to support departmental and
administration priorities. DOL is leveraging its enterprise data inventory, network of data stewards, and
analytical capabilities to assess the state of characteristic and demographic data across the enterprise, and
develop plans to make that data more fully interoperable. The DOL Data Board is working towards adoption of
a metadata standard and development of open source tools to manage that metadata and leverage it to assure
data quality and conformity to adopted standards. DOL has set up shared services for address standardization,
which will benefit data quality and strongly enhance our ability to perform entity resolution across different data
sets and programs. All of these efforts are seeking to raise DOL's data capacity and expand and improve the
potential use cases for our data.
DOL Restricted Use Data Access Program
DOL has extended the service it currently uses to support evaluation contracts and contractors to researchers.
DOL has arranged data files and supporting documentation for selected prior evaluation studies and can, under
specific circumstances, make those data sets available for secondary analysis. This capability can be extended
as well to support primary or secondary analysis of agency data sets with sensitive or non-sensitive PII under
specific circumstances. DOL will continue to work towards making the largest share of its data available, and
supporting the appropriate analysis of DOL data to create insights about program impacts, stakeholder outcomes,
and information that can support evidence based policymaking, resource allocation, and program administration.
Examination of BLS data collection and storage alternatives
A data lake is a cloud based data repository that allow users to store large amounts of unstructured/raw or
structured data. BLS is moving forward in exploring the feasibility of using a data lake to enhance the efficiency
of data collection and storage. After the proof of concept period, which included demonstrations from major
vendors in the field, a successful pilot project is now moving forward to explore the feasibility of using a data
lake to enhance the efficiency of data collection and storage. BLS is now exploring whether a data lake can be
a cost effective path to expand use of alternative data and automate some of BLS' survey functions.

Technology Modernization Fund Data Modernization Initiative
OASAM is modernizing DOL's enterprise data infrastructure to deliver enterprise capabilities in data
management, advanced analytics, and open data, leveraging the DOL IT Platform's Data Analytics Capability,
to improve the use of data for generating evidence. As part of this initiative, OASAM is examining the optimal
process for facilitating intra-agency data sharing using an existing modernized and consolidated data source,
assessing what critical enhancements to enterprise data infrastructure could enable DOL data sources to be
modernized, secured, and consolidated with data governance applied, and functioning effectively in production.
OASAM is identifying the critical enhancements to enterprise data infrastructure to enable DOL agencies to use
advanced capabilities (e.g. Al, ML, and/or Advanced Analytics).
Improving Accessibility of ETA Data Books
ETA is working to improve the accessibility and usability of data books that present information on the
characteristics, services, and outcomes of individuals served by Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act
(WIOA) and Wagner-Peyser Act programs. This is intended to facilitate research conducted by states, local
areas, and DOL, using administrative data. In past years, the data books have been produced in less accessible
formats that were difficult for researchers and practitioners to utilize. This project will enhance the usability of
the data, providing it in more customizable and accessible formats that will facilitate researchers' capacity to
search, download, analyze, and create visualizations with the data.

V. Potential Future Evidence-Building Topics
In addition to the confirmed projects listed above, DOL has identified a short list of future evidence-building
topics that are of interest to the department and/or DOL stakeholders. While DOL has an interest in exploring
the topics, it has not yet identified a specific research project to do so. The following topics may be integrated
into research activities described in Section IV (for example, as a priority topic for research grants), or they may
inform DOL's future evidence-building commitments.
These topics include:
The care economy & workforce (Possible partner
Labor-related data gaps on marginalized groups
