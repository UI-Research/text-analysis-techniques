LETTER FROM THE SECRETARY
When someone signs up to serve our country in the military,
we make them a simple promise: if you serve us, we will
serve you when you transition out of the service. That
promise dates back to President Lincoln's second inaugural
when he charged a wounded Nation to care for those "who
shall have borne the battle" and for their families and
survivors. That promise echoes into today when President
Biden reminds us that our Nation's "most sacred obligation"
is to prepare and equip the troops we send into harm's way
and to care for them and their families when they return
home. There is no more noble mission than keeping that
fundamental, enduring promise and it is our job at the U.S.
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to do exactly that.
Today, VA is keeping that promise by providing more care, more services and more
benefits to more Veterans than ever before-but, of course, we cannot stop here. We need
to fight every day to build a stronger, better VA for Veterans, their families, caregivers and
survivors because they deserve nothing less than the very best.
This strategic plan guided by VA's four fundamental principles-access, advocacy,
outcomes and excellence-sets VA's four strategic goals to achieve by 2028.
1. VA will consistently communicate with our customers and partners to assess and
maximize performance, evaluate needs and build long-term relationships and trust;
2. VA will deliver timely, accessible and high-quality benefits, care and services to
meet the unique needs of Veterans and all those we serve;
3. VA will build and maintain trust with Veterans, their families, caregivers and
survivors-as well as our employees and partners-through proven stewardship,
transparency and accountability; and
4. VA will strive toward excellence in all business operations-including governance,
systems, data and management-to improve experiences, satisfaction rates,
accountability and security for Veterans.
These goals will drive everything we do, beginning with our core responsibilities of
providing Veterans with timely, world-class health care; to ensuring that they and their
families have access to the benefits they earned; and finally, to honoring our Veterans with
a final resting place that is a lasting tribute to their service and sacrifice.
This strategic plan will help us execute our mission of serving Veterans, their families,
caregivers and survivors as well as they have served us. We will stop at nothing to meet
our goals and in doing so we will keep our promise to all those we serve.
I fully embrace this mission as does VA's workforce. May God bless our Nation's troops,
Veterans, their families, caregivers and survivors and may we always give them our best.
/s/ Denis McDonough

INTRODUCTION
On March 4, 1865, during his second inaugural address, President Abraham Lincoln
described his vision for national reconciliation and mission to bind the wounds and heal a
Nation torn apart from a lengthy civil war. In 1959, President Lincoln's immortal words
became the motto of the Veterans Affairs Administration, now the U.S. Department of
Veterans Affairs (VA or Department) and stand today as a solemn reminder of VA's
commitment to care for those injured in our Nation's defense and the families of those
killed in its service.1,

VA Mission Statement: To fulfill President Lincoln's promise, "To care for him who
shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan."
Figure 1. President Abraham Lincoln and Union Soldiers during the Civil War (1862). (Alexander
Gardner/Library of Congress). McPherson, James M. Smithsonian Magazine (January 9, 2009).
VA carries out four specific missions to fulfill President Lincoln's promise:
Veterans Health Care: VA's Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is the largest
integrated health care network in the United States, with 1,294 health care facilities
serving over 9 million enrolled Veterans each year. VA provides Service members with a
seamless transition from their U.S. Department of Defense (DoD)-provided health care
into the VA system of care.

Veterans Benefits: Veterans can receive a range of benefits and services that help them
transition back to civilian life. Through the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), VA
helps Service members transition out of military service and assists with education, home
loans, life insurance and much more.
National Cemeteries: The National Cemetery Administration (NCA) ensures those who
served this Nation are never forgotten. NCA provides dignified burial services for
Veterans and eligible family members by maintaining cemeteries as national shrines and
providing lasting tributes that commemorate their service and sacrifice to our Nation.
The Fourth Mission: VA's "Fourth Mission" is an operational capability that leverages
VA's personnel, equipment and infrastructure to support greater resource sharing across
Federal departments and agencies. By providing expanded Federal government
emergency response capacity, VA improves the Nation's preparedness and resilience to
a broad range of threats and hazards during war or national emergencies in accordance
with Presidential Policy Directive/PPD-8ยณ and the National Preparedness Goal.4 In support
of the Fourth Mission, VA maintains capabilities and develops plans for supporting
Federal response activities and processes.
Our Department remains fully committed to fulfilling the sacred obligation
that we have to those who serve in uniform.
~VA Secretary Denis McDonough5
This document presents VA's Strategic Plan for fiscal years (FY) 2022-28 and describes
the important support VA's three Administrations (VHA, VBA and NCA) and Staff Offices
will provide to Veterans, Service members, families, caregivers and survivors as we strive
to achieve the very best outcomes for them. The strategic plan highlights the mission-
focused outcomes VA intends to accomplish to improve the quality of life, outcomes and
experiences for Veterans, Service members, their families, caregivers and survivors. The
Plan also describes the stewardship goal and objectives VA seeks to attain to improve
operations and management functions ensuring the most effective use of taxpayer
resources and sustainability for future generations of Veterans. Moreover, it reinforces a
commitment to a culture of interoperability that promotes a consistently positive and
seamless Veteran experience with VA. By aligning business, data, and information,
systems and technology VA ensures the right information and services securely and
reliably reach the right person, at the right time and in the best manner to make timely,
informed decisions and to enable actions.
VA'S FOUR FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES

plan. Each implementing strategy aligns to one or more principles and connects to other
strategies to ensure a comprehensive approach to improving outcomes and experiences
throughout a Veteran's life journey, starting from the Veteran's or Service member's first
contact with VA, during military service and transition to civilian life and through end of
life. The Secretary's fundamental principles lead and manage VA in alignment with VA's
ICARE Core Values, Core Characteristics and Customer Experience Principles6, 7 to
ensure the delivery of quality and timely benefits, care and services to Veterans, their
families, caregivers, survivors and Service members.

Deliver benefits, care and services to our most vulnerable Veterans.
Reduce Veterans' homelessness and suicide.
Ensure access to educational opportunities, training and jobs worthy of the
Veteran's skills and service.

3. Outcomes-Veteran outcomes will drive everything we do.

Measure the quality and effectiveness of benefits, care and services and
Veterans' experiences and satisfaction.

and the rapid pace of change. The VA FY 2022-28 Strategic Plan describes our approach
to ensure Veterans receive timely benefits, care, memorialization and services and
ensures we deliver quality experiences and customer satisfaction that surpass
expectations today and into the future.
The strategic plan has 4 strategic goals, 13 objectives and 75 strategies that are
specifically designed to drive achievement of VA's mission and the Secretary's
fundamental principles. The strategic plan reinforces VA's communications from the
Administrations and Staff Offices to deliver clear and consistent messages. This message
demonstrates our appreciation for each Veteran's sacrifice and service and our
commitment to improving their health, well-being and economic security. Goals,
objectives and strategies guide the Department and ensure a unified effort towards
achieving VA's mission.
The strategic plan also includes performance milestones for each strategic objective.
These performance milestones describe the desired state of affairs at the end of this
strategic plan and help us understand our progress and when the necessary work is
completed. Performance milestones demonstrate through evidence that we have
achieved the strategic objective or that more work is still needed.
stakeholder
While developing this strategic plan, VA conducted more than 50
interviews with senior leaders across VA, with other Federal agencies,
Veteran Service Organizations (VSOs) and Congress that have equities
with VA and Veterans.
Examples of the stakeholders interviewed include U.S. Social Security Administration,
U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD)/Ginnie Mae, HUD/Veterans Affairs
Supportive Housing (VASH), U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), National
Institute of Health (NIH) and National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), U.S. Small
Business Administration (SBA), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), U.S. Department
of Labor (DOL), U.S. Department of Education (DOE) and DoD. VA also interviewed
Congressional members and nine VSOs. Areas where inputs from these "Stakeholder
consultations" changed direction of the plan are highlighted with the icon.
VA Learning Agenda and Capacity Assessment
The Foundations for Evidence-based Policymaking (EBP) Act of 2018ยณยน (P.L. 115-435,
the "Evidence Act") requires VA to create an "evidence-building plan" (i.e., Learning
Agenda and Capacity Assessment) and incorporate them in the strategic plan. VA's
Learning Agenda identifies strategic and operational policy questions that VA must
address and informs the strategic plan (OMB A-11, page 4 of Section 290). 32 VA's
Capacity Assessment describes the "coverage, quality, methods, effectiveness and
independence of the statistics, evaluation, research and analysis efforts" (OMB A-11,
pages 6-7 of Section 290) and it also informs the strategic plan.

2022-28 Learning Agenda and FY 2022-28 Capacity Assessment. Priority questions in
the Learning Agenda are aligned to specific strategies in Objectives 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4
and 4.4 to ensure VA will improve outcomes for underserved, marginalized and at-risk
Veterans. The Capacity Assessment describes VA's ability to perform evaluation and
evidence building activities and identifies gaps that VA must address. Six Strategic
Objectives (2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5 and 4.4) align to the Capacity Assessment. VA
developed three strategies for Objective 4.4, (4.4.7, 4.4.9 and 4.4.10) to address
capability gaps and improve our performance and the effectiveness of our evaluation and
analytical efforts.

STRATEGIC GOAL 1: VA consistently communicates with its
customers and partners to assess and maximize performance,
evaluate needs and build long-term relationships and trust.
GOAL DESCRIPTION
Goal 1 ensures communications are clear and messages are consistent across VA and
the ecosystem of Veteran-supporting partners. VA delivers information to Veterans the
way the Veteran wants to receive it, so Veterans understand their eligibility for benefits,
care, memorialization and services and how to access the benefits they earned. This goal
ensures VA knows Veterans, understands their needs and how the benefits, care and
services we deliver impacts their lives. Goal 1 enables VA to connect with Service
members early in their military careers to establish long-term relationships with them. VA
will maintain that relationship as the Service member transitions to Veteran status and
support their families, caregivers and survivors as they transition through each phase of
their life journey.
STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE 1.1: (Consistent and Easy to Understand
Information) VA and partners use multiple channels and methods to ensure
information about benefits, care and services is clear and easy to
understand and access.
STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE DESCRIPTION
Objective 1.1 describes VA's approach to delivering information and communicating with
Veterans, their families, caregivers, survivors, Service members, employees and other
stakeholders to ensure the information they need is readily available, accessible to all and
easy to understand. VA uses customer feedback and individual/aggregated data to
understand population groups and proactively distribute tailored information that meets
the needs of recipients to ensure equitable access so that all Veterans feel welcomed and
valued.

STRATEGIES
Implementing Strategy 1.1.1: (VA Welcomes all Veterans) VA proactively distributes
information and resources at every phase of the Veteran life journey, or as needed when
circumstances change, to inform and welcome all Veterans and ensure resources are
easily accessible.

Excellence
VA communicates via social media networks, mail, email, telephone, text, outreach events
and online platforms and delivers step-by-step guidance, checklists and updates on new
programs, processes and policy revisions that address all Veteran issues, including the
civilian-military divide and stigma associated with mental health conditions.
Consistent communications and information sharing begin at military service and continue
throughout the Veteran's life. Service members, Veterans, eligible family members,
caregivers and survivors receive guidance during the military-to-civilian transition, pre-
separation, post-separation, receipt of initial or revised service connection rating,
decisions from the Board, change in priority group designation, when they reach a certain
age or as circumstances change to ensure information and resources are readily
available to make informed decisions.
Implementing Strategy 1.1.2: (Equitable Access) VA and the ecosystem of
partnerships communicate in a variety of languages and in various ways to ensure
equitable access to information and resources and support those with physical and/or
intellectual disabilities.

to meet their needs and preferences. VA customizes all forms of communications for
groups and individuals whose primary language is not English and individuals with
hearing, vision and/or speech impairments. Multi-channel two-way communications allow
recipients to easily provide feedback with recommendations that enhances VA's
understanding of needs and experiences, ensures equitable access and improves the
quality of benefits, care and services provided especially to at-risk, underservedยณ5 and
marginalized36 Veterans.37
VA offers multilingual customer experiences
to meet the needs of a diverse Veteran
population and provides a variety of options
to receive information that ensures families,
caregivers and survivors get the information
they need in a manner that is easy to
understand. Communications, such as
emails, text messages and direct/postal
mail, are written in a variety of languages
with customers in mind and delivered to
meet the needs and preferences of the
recipient. Enhanced partnerships expand
VA's ability to ensure messages and
information about benefits are easy to
understand and that customers can reliably
access resources and easily connect with
VA representatives and partners for further
guidance and support.
VA and ecosystem partners that support Veterans ensure websites, web-based
applications, attached files and other published documents are written in plain language
and follow the Plain Writing Act of 2010ยณ8 to improve transparency and accessibility. VA

STRATEGIC GOAL 2: VA delivers timely, accessible, high-
quality benefits, care and services to meet the unique needs of
Veterans and all eligible beneficiaries.
GOAL DESCRIPTION
Goal 2 ensures access to resources and tailoring the delivery of benefits and customizing
care, memorialization and services to foster equity and promote independence and
optimal outcomes and well-being for Veterans, their families, caregivers, survivors and
Service members. This is the largest goal in the VA FY 2022-28 Strategic Plan with 5
objectives and 32 strategies that describe our approach or what VA will do to achieve the
objective. VA and the ecosystem of partners must work together to understand the needs
of Veteran groups and deliver benefits, care and services that address the unique needs
of individual Veterans. A thorough examination of Veteran cohorts helps VA identify
potential trends, innovations and emerging treatments that might impact Veterans at
different phases of their life journey. Trend analysis improves our understanding of
underserved, marginalized and at-risk Veterans to promote equity and access to
resources. VA is committed to delivering value to all Veterans and improving their
economic security, health and quality of life.
This strategic plan and VA's FY 2022-28 Learning Agenda are aligned and focused on
improving outcomes and quality of life for underserved, marginalized and at-risk
Veterans. Learning Agenda priority questions enhance our understanding of challenges
to improve care and services for our most vulnerable Veterans. Each Learning Agenda

question is aligned directly to an implementing strategy and priority questions span four
of the five Goal 2 Objectives (except Objective 2.5). Learning Agenda questions and
strategies are complementary; the Learning Agenda improves VA's understanding of the
specific challenges that vulnerable Veterans might face and supports strategies to
achieve the desired outcome described in the strategic objective. Detailed information on
Learning Agenda priority questions is provided in the relevant strategic objectives.
STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE 2.1: (Underserved, Marginalized and At-Risk
Veterans) VA emphasizes the delivery of benefits, care and services to
underserved, marginalized and at-risk Veterans to prevent suicide and
homelessness, improve their economic security, health, resiliency and
quality of life and achieve equity. 47,48
STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE DESCRIPTION
VA is focused on addressing needs and improving economic security, quality of life and
independence for Veterans who need us most-our at-risk, marginalized and
underserved Veterans, their families, caregivers, survivors and Service members.
Objective 2.1 ensures VA programs, initiatives and the ecosystem of partners support the
whole person and address mental health and suicide, homelessness and other
challenges impacting Veterans' well-being. This objective ensures reliable access to
benefits, care and services and promotes improved outcomes for Veterans living in rural
areas, women, minorities, American Indian and Alaska Native, severely wounded, ill and
injured, those with physical and/or intellectual disabilities, LGBTQ+ Veterans, transitioning
Service members and those at-risk for food insecurity. HCD best practices will enable VA
to deeply understand the needs and experiences of these populations.
IMPLEMENTING STRATEGY AND LEARNING AGENDA ALIGNMENT
Three strategies in Objective 2.1 align to two VHA and two VBA Learning Agenda priority
questions to understand specific challenges related to mental health and suicide risk, the
military-to-civilian transition and employment and access to care for underserved
Veterans. Research to address Learning Agenda questions and the implementation of
each implementing strategy will enable VA to drive change to achieve the objective and
47 (Executive Order 13985 Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the
Federal Government 2021). "The term 'equity' means the consistent and systematic fair, just and impartial
treatment of all individuals, including individuals who belong to underserved communities that have been
denied such treatment, such as Black, Latino and Indigenous and Native American persons, Asian
Americans and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color; members of religious minorities; lesbian, gay,
bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ+) persons; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural
areas; and persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality." (January 25, 2021).

improve outcomes for Veterans, their families, caregivers, survivors and Service
members.
Implementing Strategy 2.1.1: (Mental Health and Suicide Prevention) aligns with VHA
LA Question 3 Suicide Prevention: What strategies work best to prevent suicide among
Veterans? Implementing Strategy 2.1.1 includes three strategies specifically designed to
reduce Veteran suicide. Universal strategies to reach all Veterans. Selective strategies
to target Veterans who may be at increased risk for suicide. Indicated strategies to
connect with a smaller segment of Veterans at elevated risk of suicide or mental illness.
VHA Learning Agenda strategies include Caring Contacts/Caring Letters, which provide
messages to individuals at risk of suicidal behavior. Caring Contacts/Caring Letters aim to
evaluate the effects of messages sent to VCL callers to increase VA's knowledge of care
utilization, mental health outcomes and suicidality and identify facilitators and barriers to
program implementation.
Implementing Strategy 2.1.1 also aligns to VBA's LA question for Disability Benefits
Questionnaires (DBQs) 1c Can Disability Benefits Questionnaires (DBQs) be updated to
improve data capture capabilities for tracking at-risk Veterans with a reported level of risk
for suicide? VA will expand Veteran demographic data on benefits recipients for use in
many types of studies to understand the technical capability and whether VA can use the
tool to improve understanding of Veterans at-risk for suicide. Additional data categories
could include race/ethnicity, familial status, housing status, sexual orientation and gender
identity.
Implementing Strategy 2.1.7: (Military-to-Civilian Transition) aligns to VBA's Learning
Agenda question for Evaluation of Transition Assistance Program 2a: To what extent is
VA's Transition Assistance Program (TAP) supporting the transition needs of newly
separated Veterans? This implementing strategy ensures VA and partners provide holistic
assessments and transition support to understand "economic well-being" starting 1 year
before transition and continuing at specific intervals for 1 year post transition. The
Learning Agenda examines the transition process and the impact of multiple changes to
the Service member or Veteran's life. The Learning Agenda and Implementing Strategy
2.1.7 ensure Service members experience a seamless transition from military service to
civilian life and promote economic security for Veterans.
Implementing Strategy 2.1.8: (Rural Veterans) aligns with VHA's Learning Agenda
Question 1 Access to Care: What are the ways VA can ensure that Veterans have access
to timely care in their preferred setting? VHA implemented two strategies to increase
access and deliver quality care to Veterans. The Medical Scribes Pilot Program aims to
provide assistants to aid medical providers and increase their productivity. The second
strategy implements a study to understand primary and mental health care shortage
areas and develop action plans to address shortages. Implementing Strategy 2.1.8
ensures that VA expands partnerships, addresses workforce disparities and invests in
new models of care for Veterans in underserved areas to ensure access to quality care.

Service members and Veterans who need it, in the right time and right place and deploys
technology to reach Veterans in remote and isolated communities. Such efforts are
designed to reduce Veteran suicide through partnerships with the community to
implement tailored, local prevention plans and evidence-based clinical strategies for
intervention informed by the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline on the Assessment and
Management of Patients at Risk for Suicide. 49 Our comprehensive public health approach
operationalizes the 2018 National Strategy for Preventing Veteran Suicide50 through a

Inextricably linked to caring for and supporting Veterans and their families is
legal access
That's why VA's legal clinics and Medical Legal Partnerships
are fundamental to caring for Veterans and their families.
~VA Secretary Denis McDonough.51
VA and trusted partners implement comprehensive, nationwide efforts to increase mental
health literacy and connection to care to decrease any stigma associated with seeking
help as part of our mission to promote, protect and restore Veterans' health and well-
being. VA proactively informs family members about available resources and how to
support Veterans in engaging in care and uses Mental Health Peer Support Specialists to
foster a sense of belonging, empower individuals to seek help, enhance resiliency and
ease transition from military service.
The Office of General Counsel (OGC) partners with VHA to expand the medical-legal
partnerships (MLP) located within VA across the country. VA's MLPs provide legal
services to Veterans and their families in housing, employment and education, access to
benefits, income and family law issues. Access to MLPs have shown that Veterans who
received legal services at an MLP experienced significant mental health improvement, as
well as improvements in their housing and income. The MLP program combines the
expertise of VA staff and health care clinicians who understand the health issues that are

complexities of laws and policies that affect Veterans.
Learning Agenda
Suicide Prevention: VHA Question 3: What strategies work best to prevent suicide among
Veterans?
VA performs proactive outreach and implements communication strategies to address
suicide prevention through Caring Contacts/Caring Letters:
Caring Contacts/Caring Letters are brief, personal, non-demanding follow-up messages
sent to Veteran patients after they receive care to decrease suicide attempts. VA sends
follow-up communications (letter and digital) to Veterans who don't need to receive care
at a VA facility or who call the VCL and choose to identify themselves to the call
responder. VA is evaluating the approach in other Veteran populations, including those
seen in VA emergency departments.
Disability Benefits Questionnaires (DBQs): VBA question 1c: Can Disability Benefits
Questionnaires (DBQs) be updated to improve data capture capabilities for tracking at-
risk Veterans with a reported level of risk for suicide?
VBA will leverage DBQs to incorporate additional data sources and demographic
categories as needed and track at-risk Veterans with a reported level of high acute
(defined) and intermediate acute (defined) risk for suicide. The Learning Agenda question
will enable the use of evidence and data to improve VA's understanding of these at-risk
Veterans.

Learning Agenda
Access to Care: VHA Question 1: "How can VA ensure that Veterans have access to
timely care in their preferred setting?"
VHA launched a 2-year pilot program in emergency departments and specialty care
clinics to provide medical scribes to providers. VHA will evaluate the impact of the scribes
program on clinical efficiency, patient and provider satisfaction and identify differences
between VA and contract-hired scribes.
VHA collaborated with other research and operations offices and developed scoring
algorithms to identify underserved VA medical facilities in primary care and mental health
services. The algorithms are used to update an annual list of underserved facilities. Each
year, the top 20 underserved facilities are required to develop an action plan explaining

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE DESCRIPTION
Objective 2.2 describes how VA will expand partnerships and use them as a force
multiplier to enhance our capabilities and capacity to deliver quality benefits, care and
services that improve the lives of Veterans, their families, caregivers, survivors and
Service members based on the five domains of Social Determinants of Health (where
people are born, live, work, attend school and play). 55, 56 VA will provide Veterans with
final resting places and lasting tributes that commemorate their service and sacrifice to
our Nation. We also will strengthen partnerships across the ecosystem of Veteran
supporters and advocate for Veterans to facilitate the transition from military service to
education, employment or entrepreneurship and support our aging Veterans, their
families and caregivers. VA leverages technology to modernize the appeals process,
ensure easy access to secure VA systems and deliver benefits, health care and services
the way Veterans want to receive them.
IMPLEMENTING STRATEGY AND LEARNING AGENDA ALIGNMENT
Two strategies in Objective 2.2 align to the Learning Agenda and efforts to understand
specific challenges related to transition, post-military employment and access to care for
underserved Veterans.
Implementing Strategy 2.2.3: (Telehealth/Connected Care) aligns with VHA Learning
Agenda priority Question 1 for Access to Care: What are the ways VA can ensure
Veterans have access to timely care in their preferred setting? Both the implementing
strategy and the priority question will improve access to healthcare for Veterans.
Implementing Strategy 2.2.3 describes how virtual health technologies and devices
deliver convenient, trusted, anytime and anywhere access that empowers Veterans to
take charge of their own care needs. Connected care addresses geographic barriers and
expands VA's clinical capacity and delivers more comprehensive in-home services. For
example, Veterans can use VA's digital portal to select their preferred communication
channel and connect with VA staff members and health care professionals.
Understanding VHA's Learning Agenda question ensures VA identifies Veterans with
limited access to health care services and leverages telehealth to address shortages of

cybersecurity and privacy requirements
prioritized to reduce risks to Veterans taking
advantage of these expanded options to
care.
Connected care through telehealth increasingly allows VA to deliver care for Veterans in a
more integrated manner, to include supporting Veterans in their homes and local
communities. It also removes geographic barriers to health care access and expands VA's
clinical capacity across the health care delivery network (e.g., tele-critical care, tele-stroke
clinical resource hubs, expert consultation centers, 59 store and forward telehealth
programs and clinical contact centers). Connected care enhances VA's ability to deliver
consistent and comprehensive services to Veterans regardless of their location.
For example, connected care securely delivers services and self-management tools
directly to a Veteran's home, using VA-issued or Veteran-owned devices, to enhance the
accessibility of care. These services can be augmented by remote physical examination
tools (e.g., digital stethoscope) and touchless sensing technologies that capture biometric
data (e.g., heart rate, respiratory rate) to provide a more comprehensive remote
assessment and better understand patient status between encounters with the healthcare
team. Connected care and modern scheduling workflows allow Veterans to invite family
members, caregivers or other members of their support system to attend both telehealth
and in-person appointments to enhance outcomes and satisfaction for Veterans and
those who care for them and improve the experience for Veterans and VA staff. 60,61

Suicide Prevention: VHA question 3. What strategies work best to prevent suicide among
Veterans?
VA's Learning Agenda prioritizes suicide reduction research and emphasizes the need for
program evaluations to improve suicide prevention for Veterans. Research will help VA
identify clinical interventions to reduce suicide risk and the best modalities to deliver VHA
suicide prevention health care. Two studies align to this strategy to build evidence for the
suicide prevention Learning Agenda question:
The Randomized Evaluation of Caring Letters initiative will evaluate the effectiveness of
Caring Letters among VCL callers, assessing the impact on clinical outcomes and VA
utilization rates by comparing the contact group with rates from a comparable historical
cohort of Veteran callers to the VCL, as well as sustainability of implementing and
maintaining the VCL Caring Letters project.
Through the Recovery Engagement and Coordination for Health - Veterans Enhanced
Treatment (REACH VET) initiative, VHA will leverage predictive modeling and medical
records data to identify Veterans who are at highest statistical risk for suicide in the next
month. Coordinators and providers will work with the Veteran to determine if enhanced
care would be effective.

VHA's Learning Agenda implements three strategies derived from the ORD research
roadmap on opioid/pain treatment to better understand pain management and opioid use
and identify evidence and evidence gaps:
STORM uses case reviews and a stepped-wedge cluster randomized design to help
clinical providers identify Veterans vulnerable to negative opioid-related outcomes and
provide personalized interventions. The STORM randomized program evaluation pulls
demographic, diagnostic, pharmacy and health care utilization data to assesses Veteran
mortality and opioid-related injuries, using case reviews and a stepped-wedge cluster

Veteran Outcomes
VA is fully committed to providing benefits, health care and services to Veterans exposed
to environmental hazards during their service to the Nation. For medical conditions that
develop after military service, particularly in areas of environmental exposure, the
information needed to connect these conditions to military service is often incomplete. We
need additional research and discovery to address knowledge gaps and incomplete
scientific and medical evidence to establish a comprehensive understanding of in-service
exposures and determine whether they caused a particular condition or conditions. VA is
committed to working with partners such as DOL, the National Cancer Institute, NIH and
the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine and others across the
research spectrum to actively build relationships and investigate additional science for

Learning Agenda
Military Environmental Exposure: VHA question 4: To what extent have military
environmental exposures harmed Veterans during their period of service harmed
Veterans, especially with regard to latent or chronic adverse health effects?
Military Environmental Exposure: VHA question 5: What are the best strategies to
implement state of the art evaluation and care models to provide effective care for
Veterans exposed to burn pit smoke and other military-related airborne hazard?
VHA's Learning Agenda questions are derived from the ORD Military Exposure Research
Program (MERP), which will focus on generating and translating evidence-based
knowledge for Veterans with toxic exposure. The Learning Agenda questions will
address:
Toxic environmental exposure during military service to understand exposure-related
concerns of deployed Veterans.
Access to ongoing research and data investigating the associations between toxic
exposures and the long-term health effects to evaluate best practices and inform an
evidence-based approach for optimizing health.
Identifying the representational cohort of Veterans exposed is essential to
conducting successful program and policy evaluation.
VA collaboration teams will document best practices, create dashboards for metrics
and facilitate best practices implantation across identified medical centers.
STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE 2.5: (Value and Sustainability) VA, with
community partners, will deliver integrated care and services, balancing

VA is uniquely positioned in the U.S. health care system to serve as a payer and provider
of services. The VHA Center for Care and Payment Innovation (CCPI) is responsible for
the implementation and evaluation of care and payment innovation, authorized by section
152 of the VA Maintaining Internal Systems & Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks
Act of 2018 (MISSION Act), codified at 38 U.S.C. ยง 1703E (as implemented by 38 C.F.R.
ยง 17.450). Through this authority, CCPI leads national initiatives to test and implement
value-based care models and reduce expenditures while preserving or enhancing the
quality of care furnished by the Department. Through its approach, CCPI works to
improve Veterans' access to care and services; improve quality, timeliness and patient
satisfaction; and create cost savings for the Department.
VHA's Health Services Research & Development (HSR&D) program, under ORD, notably
through the Center of Innovation for Veteran-Centered and Value-Driven Care is driving
the move towards value-based health care and focusing on:
Promoting Veteran-centric care and improving patient experiences in VA
healthcare and community settings.
Advancing value-driven care by providing Veterans the highest quality care at
lowest financial burden.
The Innovation Ecosystem's Center for Care and Payment Innovation is leading national
initiatives focused on innovative value-based payment models. Value-based care is
defined as health outcomes achieved per dollar spent and ensures VA uses evidence to
assess the quality of health care delivered. Performance is based on reduced costs and
improved efficiencies and health outcomes for Veterans and other beneficiaries.
Page 67 of 235

value care to promote more
impactful outcomes for Veterans,
including perceptions that care is
more patient-centered, increased
engagement with health care,
self-care and improving
perceived stress, which indicates
improvements in overall well-
being.
VA will leverage comparative effectiveness research for a faster, cost-efficient way to
determine whether a treatment is effective and how the effectiveness varies for Veterans
with complex chronic conditions. It compares existing treatments to see what works best
and what poses the greatest benefits and harms for different patients or patient groups.
Statistical research assists our other high-value research goals. This effort includes
developing a new generation of statistical methods to better identify the patient, provider
and system characteristics associated with higher costs, developing innovative theoretical
concepts for measuring cost and adapting existing statistical methods to new uses to
understand the comparative effectiveness of difficult research questions.89

among business, data and system ecosystems. This alignment includes adopting and
maintaining industry standards for data elements as well as for data communications
protocols. Collecting and storing data, (to be shared between systems), using secure
open standards are key to seamlessness at optimal cost, avoiding proprietary lock-in for
storage or formatting. Equally important are creating and maintaining the infrastructure of
services and databases that support interoperability. Commercial applications run "on top"
of the VA's infrastructure to share data and information. VA's underpinning infrastructure is
"the foundation" for technical interoperability inside of VA and between VA and its external
partners.
VA and the General Services Administrator shall collaborate to provide seamless
integration of Login.gov accounts to allow customers to access VA.gov, the VA mobile

VA as a learning organization reflects a dynamic cycle of information sharing,
accessibility, feedback and improvement. It requires VA to commit to high-value employee
professional development and establishing and sharing best practices so that the entire
Department - and therefore all Veterans and other beneficiaries whom we serve -
benefit. Employees are the focus of the learning organization, without whom VA services
cannot be provided. This message is captured by the VA Chief Learning Officer's vision
that "engaged and developed VA employees will change the lives of Veterans and their
families for the better."
VA encourages and supports
continuous learning and fosters a
leadership-instilled culture of
learning, where leadership actionably
demonstrates their commitment to
employees' professional
development. VA considers the future
of work and listens to employees to
develop workforce flexibilities (i.e.,
remote work, telework, etc.) that
balance mission requirements with
employees' needs.
Employees have real-time access to knowledge, including access to high-quality,
engaging training content in a variety of formats that considers the learner and adjusts for
their needs and access to data to support and guide best practices across VA. This effort
includes having a Department-wide centralized system of records for training, data and
feedback capture (when appropriate) and governance committees to break down silos of
training and create data-sharing best practices within the Department.
VA Administrations and Staff Offices will be reviewed and rated (where appropriate) on
their commitment to continuous improvement and holistically serving Veterans and other
beneficiaries. Veterans, their family members, caregivers, survivors and Service members
need to feel engaged in the VA system, where their needs and perspectives are captured,
addressed and included in VA's continual cycle of learning and improvement. This effort
may include systematically requested feedback and providing access to relevant and

Council. Requirements management is the process of documenting, analyzing, tracing,
prioritizing and agreeing on requirements and then controlling change and communicating
to relevant stakeholders. The iRMS will build upon existing successful requirement-
development systems and fulfillment systems by linking these via enterprise knowledge
management. Together, these three elements-requirement development, fulfillment and
the enterprise knowledge management-will be linked via an information management
system to establish the iRMS.
Furthermore, VA instills tenets of the lifecycle

VA will leverage enterprise risk management to understand the relative costs, benefits
and consequences of both risks and opportunities and the connections and dependencies
between activities across the Department. VA will use analytical tools to inform and help
leaders visualize the enterprise risk portfolio, respond more rapidly to developing
situations and better forecast potential and emerging threats and opportunities. Critical to
these efforts is a renewed commitment to the quality, rigor and accuracy of risk
assessments and supporting data to ensure a more agile and responsive VA that delivers
timely, quality benefits, care and services to Veterans and other beneficiaries.
Continuous environmental scanning ensures awareness of likely or potential future trends
in global domains such as economics, international relations, technology, environmental
concerns, future of warfighting, health, human capital and other issues of special interest
to Veteran populations. These foresight efforts will ensure VA understands the trends and
forecasts related to the needs of its customers to proactively deliver the benefits, care and

Climate change is driving widespread changes to both natural and human systems. To
address climate-induced challenges, VA will continue its effort to identify mission critical
functions at risk with the goal of ensuring sustained operations to support its delivery of
benefits and services to Veterans. In support of Executive Order 14008, Tackling the
Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad, 105 VA has re-invigorated climate change discussions
across the Department.
VA will incorporate climate priorities into its infrastructure planning, as well as care and
benefits delivery, with the Office of Asset Enterprise Management's Climate Action
Plan. 106 This plan draws on VA's ongoing efforts and establishes a pathway for expanding
climate adaptation and resilience opportunities Department-wide. As climate risks are
identified, VA will review and revise design and operating standards to improve
infrastructure efficiency, sustainability and resiliency.

VBA's question for Impact of Climate Change on VA Home Loan Program: 1b: To what
extent will climate change and the financial risks it introduces affect the Home Loan
Program, and what changes would better integrate climate-related financial risks into VA
policies and financial management to mitigate financial risks?
The Learning Agenda question will enable VBA to identify financial risk to the VA Home
Loan Program and make changes to support climate improvements. Research also will
contribute to VA's understanding of how to adapt for climate change and adjust VA
guaranteed loans to avoid impacting the ability of the secondary market to adopt
Veteran's home loans.

VA's real property management objectives are a critical strategic asset and VA will design
facilities to ensure access to, or information about, the full range of VA benefits, care and
services are available to support all Veterans.
VA incorporates a value management approach to capital investments through its
Strategic Capital Investment Planning (SCIP) process to ensure an agile response to
Veterans' and other beneficiaries changing needs and marketplace volatility. SCIP
identifies current and future mission requirement gaps, focuses the Department on how
capital assets will help meet VA's mission and aligns the resources necessary to meet
critical infrastructure needs. The resulting priorities are based on clearly defined
standards consistent with projected health care workload and current and future health
care practices, considering VA mission delivery requirements.
Through SCIP, VA strives to ensure its owned and leased facilities are modern, right
sized and located to best serve Veterans and other beneficiaries. VA will leverage
existing private sector capabilities and re-balance its facility portfolio to support virtual
care modalities and ensure an agile, flexible and scalable service and benefit delivery
footprint. VA aims to leverage facilities wherever appropriate to provide Veterans and
other beneficiaries better access to care to improve outcomes and quality of life, no
matter where the Veteran is located. 107,

focus first on the why and the how, not the who, when errors occur and create an
environment in which employees feel safe to report harm or near misses with a focus on
continuous process improvement. Leaders must fairly distinguish between conduct
deserving of discipline versus the much more common unintentional human error due to
system and process failures. The journey towards high reliability and a just culture is
continuous and requires organizational and individual commitments to succeed. HRO is
achieved when employees and leaders feel psychologically safe to openly share strong
practices and lessons learned and prevent repeatable errors.

APPENDICES
Appendix A: VA Quadrennial Strategic Planning Process and
Stakeholder Consultations
The FY 2022-28 VA Strategic Plan was developed over a 2-year period using a bottom-
up and top-down approach.
Developing VA's strategic plan was a collaborative effort. More than 150 subject matter
experts from VA's Administrations, Staff Offices, field offices and interagency partners
formed the Quadrennial Strategic Planning Process (QSPP) development team. This
team developed more than 100 trend papers and conducted ten workshops from October
2019 through January 2021.
The QSPP was the framework used to develop the VA Strategic Plan. The framework
consists of six phases. Outputs from each phase become the inputs to the next phase
and are all critical for the overall success of the process. The following figure represents
the calendar year (CY) 2019-22 QSPP.

Bottom-Up Approach
Environmental Scan: The QSPP process began with a baseline environmental scan.
The baseline scan is a process that systematically surveys and interprets relevant data to
identify external opportunities and threats that could influence future decisions. In this
phase, the QSPP Development Team researched trends and drafted short papers to
provide an idea of what the world might loonativek like in 10 to 25 years. VA used the
SKEPTIC Model (Social Demographics, Kompetition/Substitution, Economics/Ecology,
Political, Technology, Industry and Customer/Citizen) to organize research conducted
during this phase. Participants developed more than 100 trend papers and reviewed over
200 other future documents to help identify those things VA must do by 2028 and beyond
to meet the needs of Service members, Veterans, their families, caregivers and survivors.
Following the completion of trend paper research, the Strategic Planning Service (SPS)
reviewed the papers and deconstructed them into "factoids." There were two
Environmental Scan Phase Workshops. During the first workshop (January 9, 2020) the
workshop participants familiarized themselves with the "factoids" then arranged them into
Page 103 of 235
VA
U.S. Department
of Veterans Affairs
groups of categories. Working in small groups, they discussed the factoids and then drew
conclusions about the relationships among the factoids in each category. Each small
group did this with each category of factoid to provide a crowd sourced group of like
factoids. From this, the small groups identified patterns of "indicators" that provided an
idea of the potential direction VA might need to follow in the future. During the second
workshop (January 30, 2020), participants distilled the high-level indicators and ranked
them using several pair-wise comparison exercises to determine which indicators had the
greatest impacts to VA and Veterans. These indicators became the potential
characteristics of drivers of change that were developed in the next QSPP phase.
Alternate Futures/Strategic Imperatives: Alternate futures, or planning scenarios,
helped us identify strategic implications so that VA might experience in disparate
operating environments. The strategic implications led to the development of strategic
imperatives and their attributes. Strategic Imperative are the characteristics VA must
emulate by 2028 to succeed in our mission regardless of the operating environment.
The first step in this phase was to finalize the strategic drivers of change using the
indicators revealed in the previous workshop. During the February 23, 2020, workshop
the participants examined two indicators at a time and imagined what the future might
look like. This process resulted in three strategic drivers of change.
Drivers of change are multi-dimensional forces expected to significantly cause or
contribute to change; a driver asserts that "this" will cause or affect "that." Drivers of
change describe the essence of what is happening in the environment. The strategic
drivers of change served as the axis lines to develop three potential alternate future
worlds for the year 2035: one optimistic, one pessimistic and one status quo. During the
March 10, 2020, workshop, participants used personas developed by Veteran Experience
Offices (VEOs) to "live" in each of the future worlds. The VEO personas are composite
portraits of real people designed to represent a group of people who currently use, or in
the future might use, VA's products or services. 110 For the workshop, participants
described their persona's needs, expectations and assumptions and the implications for
their persona, VA and Veterans in each world. The results of these descriptions led to
VA's strategic imperatives (see the following discussion). Strategic imperatives describe
the critical characteristics and behaviors that VA must emulate, and the most important
outcomes VA must achieve by 2028; they depict a desired future state and drive the Gap
Analysis and Strategic Options phases of the QSPP. They are the foundation of the VA
Strategic Plan.

Gap Analysis: The Gap Analysis phase helped us develop an understanding of the
current state of VA and used the approved strategic imperatives as the foundation to
develop the desired "to be" or future state of VA. There were two workshops in this phase.
During the April 9, 2020, workshop, participants examined the high-level gaps that
currently impede VA's ability to achieve the strategic imperatives and identified the
differences between the current state (where we are now) and the desired future state
(where we need to be). Workshop participants provided thoughts on how the current gaps
impede VA from achieving the VA strategic imperatives by examing the imperative
attributes using a framework comprised of policies, programs, people and processes. In
the next workshop (June 3, 2020) participants prioritized the draft gap statements
developed in the previous workshop by using a Likert scale to prioritize using three
criteria: impact to Veteran outcomes, impact on trust in VA and impact on VA employees.
The gap statements were reviewed by the Administration and Staff Offices for
concurrence and during the Strategic Options phase, we developed high-level
approaches that would close the gaps identified during the previous phase, articulating
VA's desired outcomes for 2028. This phase defined the desired outcomes for
employees, Veterans and ecosystem partners and answered key questions such as,
"How do we close the strategic gaps?" "What are VA's desired outcomes by 2028 and
what are our options for achieving them?" There were two workshops in this phase
(September 17, 2020, and October 7, 2020). During the workshops, participants used the
VEO persona to analyze the approved strategic gaps at each phase of the Veteran's
Journey Map and then developed options from a specific persona's perspective to
address the needs, wants, struggles and opportunities to improve outcomes for Service

members, Veterans, their families, cargivers and survivors. The results of the workshop
were then refined and consolidated through multiple reviews, resulting in 23 draft
Strategic Options. Strategic Options were reviewed by the Administrations and Staff
Offices for concurrence and then approved by the VA Operations Board (VAOB).
Strategic Goals/Objectives: During this phase, we used the outputs from the previous
phases and inputs from key internal and external stakeholders to develop VA's draft FY
2028 strategic goals, strategic objectives, strategies and performance goals. There were
two workshops in this phase. During the first workshop (December 17, 2020), participants
discussed characteristics of strategic options and identified the most important, second
most important and third most important characteristics. Then participants moved the
most important identified characteristics to the goal position, the second most important to
the strategic objective position and the third most important to strategy positions on the
exercise template. During the second workshop (January 21, 2021) participants distilled
resulting goal, objective and strategy groupings from the previous workshop into their top
five. They also identified potential performance goals and milestones for success, the
measurable targets to achieve and possible lead coordinating office or co-leads for each
strategic objective. Following completion of the workshop, the SPS team coordinated with
numerous Staff Offices to develop the specific wording for the goals and strategic
objectives and sought specific subject matter experts to develop strategies.
Top-Down Leadership Input
Input from VA senior leadership was provided through concurrence in the Veterans Affairs
Integrated Enterprise Workflow Solution (VIEWS) for the strategic imperatives, capability
gaps, strategic options, goals and objectives as well as the draft and final plan. SPS used
the resulting VIEWS outputs to help develop and modify the Goals, Strategic Objectives
and Strategies that are in the plan. The goals and strategic objectives were also briefed at
several VAOBs and VA Executive Boards (VAEB) for senior leader input and approval.
Stakeholder Consultation
Stakeholder
To develop the plan, we conducted more than 50 interviews with senior
leaders across VA, other Federal agencies that have equities with VA
and Veterans, Veteran Service Organizations (VSOs) and members of
Congress. VA's VSO liaison and Congressional liaison offices assisted
with coordinating the interviews.
The SPS team developed an extensive compendium document that included the
interviewees' responses and an analysis of the results; the team also developed a
summary document to help develop the FY 2022-28 VA Strategic Plan. The interview
participants from other Federal agencies included:

Appendix B: FY 2022-23 Agency Priority Goals
An Agency Priority Goal (APG) is a specific, challenging goal that can be accomplished in
a two-year period, offering a high priority opportunity for improvement. VA identified five
FY 2022-23 APGs to support improvements in near-term outcomes for Veterans, their
families and their caregivers and advance progress on strategic goals and objectives in
the Strategic Plan: Suicide Prevention - Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, Accessibility - Rural
Health Workforce - Expanding Connected Care - Caregiver Support Program.
Suicide Prevention
Goal Statement: VA is meaningfully contributing to whole of government and community-
based efforts to target an overall 10% reduction in Veteran suicide rate from 2019 to
2024, with decreases in the long term of 3% annually by 2028, through enhancement of
programs and training focused on community interventions. To help achieve this, VA will
concentrate on non-VA providers who often lack training on specific suicide reduction
tools for Veterans.
By September 30, 2023, the VA will:
Provide opportunities to Community care network (CCN) providers for training in
suicide risk identification, lethal means safety (LMS) and safety planning. By
September 30, 2023, the Veterans Health Administration will offer trainings to
100% of the CCN providers who are signed-up for VHA communication and take
actions to achieve an increase of 10% in FY23 over FY22 baseline training
completions.
Achieve a 10-fold increase in the number of community providers, including but
beyond the CCN, who have completed lethal means safety training within localized
suicide hotspots identified, using CDC and VA provisional data.
Increase by 100%, gun lock distribution to community-based providers.
APG Alignment FY 2022-28 Strategic Objective:
STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE 2.1: (Underserved, Marginalized and At-Risk Veterans) VA
emphasizes the delivery of benefits, care and services to underserved, marginalized and
at-risk Veterans to prevent suicide and homelessness, improve their economic security,
health, resiliency and quality of life and achieve equity.

Appendix C: Strategic Plan Environmental Influences and
Supporting Data
To understand the intricacies of VA's future operating environment, the Office of
Enterprise Integration (OEI) conducted an environmental scan of primary and secondary
research. A diverse group of stakeholders from VA and other Federal agencies examined
a variety of issues related to technology, economics, industry, socio-demographics,
politics, customer experience and competitive advantage to identify trends that may affect
Veterans and VA operations 10, 20 and even 30 years into the future. The research
confirmed that VA operations continue to face a challenging operating environment-one
intensified by the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic forced the Nation to
confront the biggest public health challenge in a century, which resulted in major
economic and social disruptions and trends accelerating at an unprecedented rate (i.e.,
digitization, telehealth, managing a distributed workforce, inclusivity and equity-centered
design). The information provided in Appendix C supports our focus on the goals,
objectives and strategies highlighted in the VA FY 2022-28 Strategic Plan.
External Influences
External influences describe important events or issues occurring outside VA that could
impact operations, such as the financial and budgetary implications of the rising cost of
Veterans benefits, rapid pace of technology and VA's ability to keep up, growing divide
between civilian and military populations and changing demographics of Veterans.
Financial and Budgetary Implications
The U.S. Government's fiscal situation, primarily the size of the Federal deficit and the
percentage of funds that must service our debt, could constrain discretionary spending for
the foreseeable future and limit benefits and services available to Veterans from other
Federal agencies and private sector organizations. After years of expanding growth, VA's
budget could plateau or even shrink as military conflicts become less likely. September
2021 marked the 20-year anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. Many Service members who
spent most of their careers in a deployed, operational or elevated state of readiness will
transition to Veteran status and likely require increased support for service-connected
disabilities, for example.
The global scope and operational tempo of U.S. deployments, the nature of each
successive wartime conflict and the will to engage in conflicts are constantly changing
factors. These factors can contribute to Veterans' high complexity needs such as
traumatic brain injury (TBI), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), opioid use disorder
(OUD), substance use disorder (SUD), toxic exposures, chronic pain presentations,
polytrauma, moral injury and military sexual trauma (MST). The escalating cost of health
care, education and other benefits and services is a persisting challenge exacerbated by
the continuous evolution of society, for example, the disconnect between military and
civilian experience, an aging population, the cost of multiple modernization efforts and
new/replacement buildings (such as medical facilities to meet the evolving needs of
Veterans).

Rising Costs of Veteran Benefits
In the past two decades, VA's budget has more than quintupled; in FY 2001, the budget
was roughly $45 billion. For FY 2021, the total was $243 billion. Health Care and
Disability Compensation/Pension, the largest programs, increased by 21% and 47%,
respectively, between FY 2008 and FY 2017. VA Health Care and Disability
Compensation are the two most frequently used programs by our Nation's Veterans. In
FY 2017, these two programs alone accounted for 77% of all VA expenditures ($140

Civilian to Military Divide
Less than 1% of Americans serve in the military compared to 12% of the population
during World War II. An increasing divide between civilian and military populations and a
potentially emerging "Veteran fatigue" could lead to diminished public and Congressional
support for Veterans' programs. A poll in 2018 found that about 42% of American voters
were either unaware of the continuing conflicts in the Middle East or convinced the War
on Terror was over. An aspect of changing American culture is the increasing divide
between those who have served in the military and those who have not. This civilian-
military divide poses significant and often misunderstood challenges when addressing the
needs and experiences of Veterans after leaving military service. 112

Technology
The rapid spread of smartphones, wearable sensors and artificial intelligence (AI) tools
offers new opportunities for scaling access to mental health care. The most promising
technologies available today may reduce gaps in mental health care as well as inform
forthcoming innovations that may transform future care. In addition, new engineering and
technological methods may improve the lives of Veterans with prosthetic systems or to
activate paralyzed nerves, muscles and limbs. 113
Veteran Cohorts by Conflict or War
As the nature of war and conflict evolves, so does the nature of the Veteran population.
There are significant differences between Veteran cohorts that can be attributed to
generational differences as well as the differences in care and benefits offerings by VA
and the community. A quick synopsis of the major characteristics of each Veteran war
cohort follows:
World War II and Korean Conflict Veterans: 16,112,566 Veterans served during
World War Il (December 7, 1941, to December 31, 1946) and another 5,720,000
served during the Korean Conflict (June 25, 1950, to July 27, 1953). They are the
Nation's oldest Veterans, and all are in their nineties or older. In September 2019,
an estimated 389,000 WWII Veterans and 1,165,000 Korean Conflict Veterans
were still living.
Vietnam Veterans: 8,744,000 Veterans served during the Vietnam War (August 5,
1964, to May 27, 1975) and approximately 6,262,000 were living in September
2019. They are age 65 years and older and approximately one-third of Vietnam-era
Veterans are 70% or more disabled.
Pre-9/11 or Gulf War I Veterans: 6,516,030 Veterans (959,554 females) served
during the Pre-9/11 Gulf War era (August 1990 to September 10, 2001).
Approximately 1.1 million Veterans deployed to the Persian Gulf region during this
time and 763,337 Veterans served in theater during Operations Desert Shield,
Desert Storm, or the post-Desert Storm stabilization period (August 1990 to
January 1992). 114
Post-9/11 or Gulf War II Veterans: More than 4.4 million Veterans have served in
the military since October 2001. These Veterans are also known as Global War on
Terrorism (GWOT) and Gulf War II Veterans. They are the youngest war cohort,
more racially diverse than Veterans who served during other eras and more women
(33.2% of women Veterans) served during the post-9/11 era than any other period
(compared to peacetime: 24.9%; pre-9/11: 23.3%; Vietnam: 13.1%; Korea: 3%; and
WWII: 2.5%). Nearly half (48%) of all post-9/11 Veterans deployed to Iraq or
Afghanistan and many deployed to both nations; and because the GWOT is an

approximately 5.4 million.

Most male Veterans served during the Vietnam Era and most female Veterans served during the Post-
9/11 Gulf War era. WWII and Korean Conflict Veterans are much more likely to use VA benefits and
service than other cohorts.

Internal Influences
This section describes VA's fundamental priorities to deliver quality experiences and
customer satisfaction and the potential challenges that may impact VA's ability to improve
outcomes for Veterans, their families, caregivers and survivors. These challenges include
access to benefits, health care, memorialization and services for all Veterans, mental
health and suicide prevention, homelessness, providing value and ensuring inclusion,
diversity, equity and access to VA resources for underserved, marginalized and at-risk
Veterans. VA must understand these challenges and prepare to address them to ensure
Veterans receive the benefits, care and services they earned and deserve.

VA Fundamental Principles
In February 2021, the Secretary of VA was sworn into office and identified the four
fundamental principles to improve Veteran outcomes and make VA safe and equitable for
all:
Advocacy: VA will be the Nation's premier advocate for Veterans, their families,
caregivers and survivors.
Access: VA will provide timely access to VA resources. These resources include
home care along with caregiver training and support. This principle also aims to
reduce Veterans' homelessness and suicide.
Outcomes: Veteran outcomes will drive everything we do. This principle aims to
measure the quality and effectiveness of benefits, care and services and Veterans'
experiences and satisfaction.
Excellence: VA will seek excellence in all we do for Veterans. This principle aims to
ensure that every Veteran is afforded access to VA's capacity and resources.
Veterans' Access to Health Care
The health care needs of Veterans differ from the health care needs of non-Veterans.
Many physicians in the United States are acquainted with health care for Veterans offered
through VA, as roughly 70% of current physicians in the United States received some
portion of their medical training in VA health care facilities. However, most health care
providers do not ask patients about their military service and are not aware of resources
available to Veterans and their families. More than half of Veterans in the United States
receive some or all their health care from the private sector, 116 and it is unknown if those
in the private sector have awareness of military culture or if the Veteran population is well-
understood.
Veterans and active-duty Service members are part of a unique culture; it is important for
providers to understand this culture to better serve this population. 117 Understanding the
unique population that VA serves along with understanding the complexities of the VA
system are essential factors to consider when addressing the Secretary's four
fundamental principles. Internal influences reveal important issues that impact VA
operations such as suicide prevention, health equity, Veteran experience, quality and
value of services, maintaining trust in VA and embracing innovative approaches to
improve outcomes.
In accordance with the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, the Creating Options
for Veterans Expedited Recovery (COVER) Commission completed its Congressionally
mandated tasks and provided recommendations to the President of the United States
(POTUS), the U.S. Congress and the Secretary of VA in 2020. The COVER
Commission's charge required far-reaching examinations of treatment models used by
VA to deliver mental health care to Veterans. Comprehensive, evidenced-based reviews
of key treatment modalities, public meetings, site visits to VA facilities and direct

117 (Burek 2018). Military Culture: Working with Veterans.
Page 116 of 235
VA
U.S. Department
of Veterans Affairs
conversations with Veterans contributed to the final COVER Commission Report, which
identified gaps in the coordination of care for high-risk Veterans. VA has many residential
rehabilitation treatment programs (RRTPs) for PTSD, SUDs and homelessness
distributed throughout the enterprise that provide critical care for some of the most
vulnerable Veterans. However, feedback from Veterans and providers revealed that
RRTPs are difficult to access, and Veterans are often referred to community care despite
the availability of RRTP beds in neighboring VA facilities. 118
Value, Quality and Experience
Value-based arrangements are health care payment and delivery models designed to
reward health care professionals for the quality of health care provided rather than the
quantity of services rendered. 119 Value-based programs are part of a quality strategy to
reform how health care is paid for and delivered. According to the Centers for Medicare &
Medicaid Services (CMS), value-based programs support better care for individuals,
better health for populations and are lower cost. 120 The value-based care model pays
providers (hospitals, labs, doctors, nurses and others) based on the health outcomes of
their patients and the quality of services rendered. This model differs from the traditional
fee-for-service model where providers are paid for each medical service. While quality
care can be provided under both models, it's the difference in how providers are paid,
combined with the way patient care is managed, that allows for health improvements and
savings.
Team-based care is a core element of value-based care. Teams focus on prevention,
wellness and coordination throughout the care continuum which are especially important
for managing chronic conditions. While not all team members provide direct medical care,
they work together with the patient and caregivers to help identify and address everyone's
health care needs. Patients are the central part of this team. Providers engage patients,
help them solve their own problems and better manage their total health. Open
communication and sharing of information among these teams enhances trust and
engagement and empowers patients to take better care of themselves between visits. 121
Health care today lacks strong evidence on what treatments are effective and evidence
does not always include the degree to which a treatment is effective for Veterans with
complex chronic conditions. 122 Understanding the patient experience is an important step
in moving toward patient-centered care. By looking at the interactions that patients have
with the health care system as a whole and with doctors, nurses and staff, it is possible to
assess the extent to which patients are receiving care that is respectful and responsive to
individual preferences, needs and values.123
VA is undergoing a major reorganization to transform the way it provides services for its
Veterans. This transformation involves legislation such as the VA MISSION Act
118 (Department of Veterans Affairs n.d.). COVER Commission.
119 (Congressional Research Service 2020). Paving the Way for Value-Based Health Care.
120 (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services n.d.). Value-Based Programs.

(Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks). The
MISSION Act established the community care program including the coordination of VA
and non-VA care, virtual care (e.g., telemedicine), use of value-based payment models
and enhancing access and quality care for all Veterans with a special focus on
underserved areas. With the implementation of the MISSION Act, Veterans are given
more health care options and additional care is being delivered by the community. The
MISSION Act is driving the evolution of VHA's role as a health care payor in addition to
health care provider for millions of Veterans nationwide.
Mental Health and Suicide Prevention
The Secretary identified suicide as a national health crisis, an epidemic with no single
solution that requires the same drive and unified approach that was unleashed during the
COVID-19 pandemic. He stated that VA's collective engagement of ideas, services,
programs and people needs to be strengthened and unified by a single vision to make
substantial progress and end Veteran suicide. 124 The Secretary articulated that VA will
unify and augment the management of suicide prevention efforts, ensuring and resources
are focused on achieving better outcomes for Veterans and their families, caregivers and
survivors. 125
One-third of Veterans surveyed have experienced suicidal thoughts. Between 2005 and
2016, the suicide rate for Veterans increased 25.9%. In 2016, the suicide rate, adjusted
for age and gender, was 1.5 times greater for Veterans than non-Veterans, with an
average of more than 6,000 Veteran suicides per year. Despite efforts to improve mental
health care for Veterans, this population remains at risk for suicide. On average, 17
Veterans die by suicide every day. 126 Veterans experience mental health and SUDs,
PTSD and TBI at disproportionately higher rates compared to their civilian counterparts.
Successful Veteran reintegration into civilian life rests upon providing Veterans with
training that builds on their military knowledge and skills, finding employment post-
separation from service, preventing homelessness and providing mental health programs
that promote the transition to civilian life. 127 While the treatment of PTSD largely stems
from the mental health system, professionals in other fields also interact with people with
a history of trauma and PTSD. These professionals also may cope with their own issues
around trauma.128 According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration (SAMHSA), rauma-informed care includes having a basic understanding
of how trauma affects the life of individuals seeking services.129
Inclusion, Diversity, Equity and Accessibility (I-DEA)
The Secretary launched a health equity review of all policies regarding care and services
provided to LGBTQ+ and other Veterans and established a 120-day task force to

The success of a Veteran's transition is influenced by factors such as their health,
employment, housing and financial stability. These factors are known as the social
determinants of health (SDOH). While VA provides critical and effective care for Veterans,
many SDOH lie beyond the reach of traditional health care systems. Genetic factors and
health care access are not the only determinants of an individual's health outcomes.
Many populations often face barriers to health in their everyday lives. Social and
economic disadvantages such as poverty, lack of educational opportunity, food insecurity
and/or neighborhood crime can result in poor health outcomes and health disparities. 131
It is critical for governments, private businesses, non-profits, community organizations
and health care systems to understand SDOH and address challenges related to housing,
transportation and social services. Through community health assessments and long-
range planning, policy, system, environmental and programmatic changes, SDOH can
improve in communities with the poorest health outcomes. A 2019 U.S. Government
Accountability Office (GAO) report revealed that Veterans from underserved communities
continued to face barriers to accessing VA health services. 132 Challenges in collecting
SDOH data are related to patients sharing personal information and linked to the training

Women Veterans
The percentage of female Veterans who used VA benefits increased from 36% in FY
2008 to 50% in FY 2017. The corresponding rate among male Veterans in FY 2008 and
FY 2017 was 39% and 49%, respectively. 134 The ORH is focused on increasing access to
health care for rural women Veterans, which includes telehealth, maternity care,
obstetrics, gynecology and mental health care services for women Veterans. 135
The rate of growth in the number of female Veterans who used VA is over 5 times the rate
of growth of the overall female Veteran population.

Veteran Homelessness
There are roughly 37,000 homeless Veterans in the United States. 136 The number of
Veterans experiencing homelessness increased in FY 2020 even before the effects of the
COVID-19 pandemic damaged employment prospects and financial resources for many
communities. For the first time since FY 2010, Veteran homelessness among family
households did not decline in FY 2020. 137 In addition to the complex set of factors
influencing all homelessness (extreme shortage of affordable housing, livable income and
access to health care) many displaced and at-risk Veterans live with the lingering effects
of PTSD and substance abuse, which are compounded by a lack of family and social
support networks. In addition, military occupations and training are not always
transferable to the civilian workforce, placing some Veterans at a disadvantage when
competing for employment. Research indicates that some Veterans have unrealistic
expectations of the transferability of the skills obtained while serving and feel frustrated by
having to "start over" in entry-level positions. 138
Interagency partners have made various program changes in recent years to address
challenges that transitioning Service members face in obtaining and keeping meaningful
employment. The Veterans Employment and Training Service through DOL facilitates
several programs and activities during and after transition that are aimed specifically at
helping Veterans and their spouses obtain meaningful employment.
139
Many Veterans find it challenging to identify support services within their community after
they transitioned. Expanded public-private partnerships can reinvigorate local
organizations, orchestrate efforts to affect real change and help Veterans navigate a
complex bureaucratic landscape. Recent research suggests that Veterans' families
transitioning to civilian life desire program content that includes assistance for family
members and children in the form of information, practical skills, support and parenting
programs. 140 Listening to the voice of the Veteran provides critical input in shaping the
future of transition assistance to ensure that each Veteran has a personal transition
success story. A support network of both family and peers is an important foundation for
navigating the military-to-civiliar transition to ensure a path to whole health and economic
stability for those transitioning to civilian life.
Caregivers
VHA serves more than 9 million enrolled Veterans annually. An estimated 25% of
enrollees report needing the support of a caregiver. For caregivers, the stress of
managing responsibilities, tasks and other needs may take a toll physically, emotionally
and mentally. 141 Section 161 of the MISSION Act required VA, in a phased approach, 142
to expand the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers of eligible

Veterans' Trust in VA
VEO captures and analyzes the voices of Veterans, their families, caregivers and
survivors through human-centered design research and VA's Veterans Signals (VSignals)
platform. VSignals is a near real-time survey instrument that captures customer sentiment
for service recovery and program improvement. Each quarter VSignals surveys
approximately 257,000 Veterans with recent interactions VA-wide with claims, appeals,
health care, memorials and other services to rate their overall trust in VA. VSignals survey
data for Quarter 2 of FY 2021 showed that 79% of Veterans using VA services trusted
VA, up from 55% in FY 2016 when VA first started surveying Veterans about trust. 143 The
same survey shows that VA's ease of use, effectiveness and its staff's ability to provide
an empathetic experience (emotion) increased as well.

UNDERSERVED, MARGINALIZED AND AT-RISK VETERANS
Many Veterans, their families and caregivers face profound challenges connected to their
service. In addition to the challenges related to mental health and/or TBI, worldwide
deployments to war zones and/or conflict areas may result in health issues related to
environmental hazards. Moral injury can occur when someone engages in, fails to
prevent, or witnesses acts that conflict with their values or beliefs. Examples of events
that may lead to moral injury include:
143 (Department of Veterans Affairs 2021). Veteran Trust in VA.
Page 122 of 235

Having to make decisions that affect the survival of others or where all options will
lead to a negative outcome.
Doing something that goes against your beliefs (referred to as an act of
commission).
Failing to do something in line with your beliefs (referred to as an act of omission).
Witnessing or learning about such an act.
Experiencing betrayal by trusted others. 144
Morally injurious experiences may lead to feelings of moral distress such as guilt, shame
and anger. Moral injury is a lasting psychological, spiritual, behavioral or social impact
that may result from these experiences.145
MST refers to sexual assault or sexual harassment experienced during military service,
and it can happen to anyone regardless of gender. MST includes any sexual activity that
you are involved with against your will. 146 All of these important areas require an
enhanced understanding of trauma-informed care which includes having a basic
understanding of how trauma affects the life of individuals seeking services.
There are six health registries for Veterans who have had exposure to certain
environmental hazards: Agent Orange, Airborne Hazards and Open Burn Pit, Depleted
Uranium Follow-up, Gulf War, lonizing Radiation and Toxic Embedded Fragments. 147
Compared to their counterparts, a higher percentage of post-9/11 Veterans used
compensation & pension, education, home loan and VR&E benefits. A crucial component
of Veteran wellness and successful transition is mental health and suicide prevention.
Suicide is a serious public health issue that causes unmeasurable pain to communities,
families and individuals nationwide. Engaging community and public-private partners in
the transition ecosystem is important to improve and adapt transition assistance. 148
Special Emphasis Groups
An estimated 1 million lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or queer (LGBTQ+) Veterans
live in the United States, many of whom take advantage of VA's health services. As a
result of stigma, stress and discrimination, LGBTQ+ Veterans face increased health risks
and unique challenges in health care. 149
Over the past 30 years, racial and ethnic minorities have entered the military in increasing
numbers. 150 In 2014, minorities comprised 22.6% of the total Veteran population in the
United States. By 2040, minorities are projected to make up 35.7% of all living Veterans.
VHA serves a Veteran population that is more racially and ethnically diverse and rapidly

In 2017, there were 158,217 American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) Veterans, of
which 65,749 used at least one VA benefit or service. A higher percentage of AIAN
Veterans have a disability compared with all other Veterans (38.8% versus 30.2%,
respectively). A lower percentage of AIAN Veterans (41.6%) used at least one VA benefit
or service compared to Veterans of all other races (52.7%). AIAN Veterans have played a
vital role in the United States military for over two hundred years. ORH, IHS, Office of
Tribal Government Relations (OTGR) and Office of Community Care (OCC) collaborate to
provide oversight and management of the VHA/Indian Health Service (IHS) Memorandum
of Understanding, which facilitates programs to increase access to care and services for
AIAN Veterans. The VHA/IHS collaboration achieved success in extending telehealth
services from VHA to IHS facilities, increasing VHA providers' cultural awareness and

In April 2021, VA conducted tribal consultation focused on updating the 2011 agency
tribal consultation policy and has been providing OMB with regular updates regarding
revisions to the policy along with an agency tribal consultation plan. In October 2021, the
VA Advisory Committee on Tribal and Indian Affairs was formally established and
convened its first meeting in January 2022. The Committee has, by statute, responsibility
for supporting the agency in its tribal consultation efforts and will be providing input into
the final proposed revisions to the agency policy. VA anticipates that the final draft,
including input from tribal leaders and the Committee, will be published in the Federal
Register late summer of 2022.
Military to Civilian Transition and Reintegration
Approximately 75% of Service members who separated in 2017 were between the ages
of 17 and 34. In 2018, VA revised its Transition Assistance Program (TAP) curriculum to
better meet the needs of this younger, more diverse population. Approximately 75% of
post-9/11 Veterans are under age 45.
When Service members transition to civilian life and become Veterans, the transition and
reintegration process is often rife with challenges. Some leave the military with service-
related disabilities such as PTSD, TBI or depression that further complicates the
reintegration to civilian life.
The stigmatization of such unseen disabilities can make transition even more challenging
for many Veterans which increases the need for proactive support to transitioning Service
members at-risk for suicide, homelessness, unemployment and economic insecurity.
Transitional stress is the heightened amount of stress that Service members experience
when they leave active duty for civilian life. Symptoms of transitional stress may include
fear and worry about adjusting to a new routine and lifestyle, connecting with family and
friends and finding employment. Transitional stress occurs in the initial period when the
Service member returns home, whereas mental health disorders such as PTSD,
depression and anxiety persist after the initial transition period and may include more
severe symptoms. However, the symptoms of transitional stress and these mental health
disorders can overlap and be difficult to separate; therefore, transitional stress is often
misdiagnosed.

Rural Veterans
Almost a quarter of all Veterans in the United States (4.7 million), return from military
careers to reside in rural communities. While Veterans may enjoy the benefits of rural
living, they also may experience rural health care challenges that are intensified by
combat-related injuries and illnesses. Rural Veterans enrolled in VA's health care system
are significantly older than non-rural Veterans: 55% are over the age of 65. This older
Veteran population is more likely to suffer from diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure and
heart conditions that require more frequent, ongoing and costly care. The younger
generation of rural Veterans also experiences multiple medical and combat-related
issues, which will require significant on-going access to care. More than 301,000 rural
Veterans served in Iraq and Afghanistan. In rural areas, basic levels of health care or
preventive care may not be available to support long-term health and well-being.

Leveraging partnerships with qualified health centers, critical access hospitals, rural
health centers, Tribal health centers and IHS are essential elements of health care
delivery in rural communities. 155
Expanding telehealth is also an essential element, but rural areas are often challenged
with limited broadband capacity. ORH continues to work with Federal agencies in the
Broadband Interagency Working Group to improve coordination across programs, reduce
regulatory barriers to broadband deployment and promote awareness of the importance
of Federal support for broadband investments. Working alongside agencies like the DOL,
DOC and DOT, ORH works to expand rural broadband access and empower telehealth
solutions that connect rural Veterans with needed care. 156
Aging, Frail and End of Life Veterans of All Ages
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the U.S. population aged 65 years or older is
expected to nearly double over the next 30 years, reaching an estimated 83.7 million by
2050. VA projects the number of VHA enrollees of all ages to decrease slightly,
approximately 8%, between FY 2019 and FY 2039, but the number of enrollees aged 85
and older is projected to increase by approximately 38% and women Veteran enrollees
aged 85 and older will increase by over 200%. 157, 158,
159
As Veterans age, VA will provide benefits and services that address a variety of issues
including the changing health risks they face, as well as financial challenges through VA
benefits and health services. In 2021, VA joined the National Age-Friendly Health
Systems Initiative and Committed to Care Excellence for Older Adults.
Becoming an Age-Friendly Health System involves providing four evidence-based
elements of high-quality care to all older adults in a health care system. Known as the
"4Ms," VA delivers what Matters, Medication, Mentation and Mobility.
Growth in the aging population has left health care systems behind as they struggle to
establish an Age-Friendly Health System and provide reliable evidence-based care to
every older adult at every care interaction. Age-Friendly Health Systems follow an
essential set of evidence-based practices, cause no harm and align with the 4Ms to
deliver what matters most to older Veterans and their family caregivers. Many VA health
systems are on the list of Age-Friendly Health Systems and others are working on
implementing the 4Ms to be recognized as Age-Friendly Health Systems 160, 161

An initiative of The John A. Hartford Foundation and the Institute for Healthcare
Improvement (IHI) in partnership with the American Hospital Association (AHA)
and the Catholic Health Association of the United States (CHA).
Aging in Place is an initiative to increase access and availability to Home & Community
Based Services (HCBS) to allow Veterans to live at home or the least restrictive
environment possible. The delay of prevention of nursing home care with the use of
HCBS services has provided significant long-term savings in many state Medicaid
programs since the costs of nursing home care are significantly higher than HCBS
services. 162
The VHA GEC covers care for not only aging Veterans but also provides home care, end
of life care and long-term care for Veterans of all ages in all care settings. VCP is a
national initiative to ensure all Veterans and their caregivers have access to the widest
range of choices and services. VCP is a joint project of VHA's Offices of Geriatrics and
Extended Care, Community Engagement, Rural Health, Mental Health, Voluntary
Services and Caregiver Support.
VCPs are coalitions of Veterans and their caregivers, VA facilities, community health
providers, organizations and agencies that provide seamless access and transitions
among the full continuum of care and support services throughout VA and the community.
Of 19 million Veterans, 9 million are enrolled in VA health care, 47% of enrolled Veterans
are over age 65 and 70% of Veterans receive additional health care from non-VA

VA facility to establish and nurture community partnerships that facilitates access to and
coordination of the broad spectrum of health care needs of all Veterans and their
families. 163
Pain Management and Addiction
On July 22, 2016, President Obama signed into law the Comprehensive Addiction and
Recovery Act of 2016 (P.L. 114-198) 164 This is the first major Federal addiction legislation
in 40 years and the most comprehensive effort undertaken to address the opioid
epidemic, encompassing all six pillars necessary for such a coordinated response:
prevention, treatment, recovery, law enforcement, criminal justice reform and overdose
reversal. 165
VHA's Whole Health System transformation expanded complementary and integrative
health (CIH) therapies as part of standard medical care. This expansion is being driven by
several factors, including mounting evidence of the effectiveness of these therapies for
many conditions, increasing demand from Veterans, increasing need to offer non-
pharmacologic pain management strategies to counter the opioid epidemic and significant
support from Congress and VA leadership. However, continued expansion of CIH
therapies require more resources to provide optimal access to meet demand and
improved integration. 166 According to the Whole Health System of Care Evaluation-A
Progress Report on Outcomes of the Pilot at 18 Flagship Sites-26% of Veterans with
chronic pain used complementary and integrative health (CIH) services. There was a
threefold reduction in opioid use, from 38% to 11%, among Veterans with chronic pain
who used whole health services compared to those who did not. 167 In 2017, 67.8% of
drug overdoses were with prescription opioids. The rate of OUD among VHA patients is
seven times higher than that of non-VHA enrollees. 168
Adding to the complexity of treating pain in Veterans are increasing numbers of Veterans
struggling with behavioral and mental health issues related to PTSD and TBI. 169 These
conditions are strongly associated with SUDs, as are other problems experienced by
returning military personnel, including reintegration stresses, sleep disturbances and
violence in relationships.170 Onset of SUDs also can emerge secondary to other mental
health problems associated with these stressors, such as PTSD and depression. 171

Health Care System researchers found that opioids were not superior to non-opioids for
improving pain related function over 12 months. In fact, non-opioid medications were
more effective than opioids for reducing pain intensity. The results do not support starting
opioid therapy for moderate to severe chronic back pain, hip or knee osteoarthritis pain.
The study found no advantages of opioids that would outweigh their risk of serious
harm. 172
Substance Abuse
Service members transitioning from active duty to civilian life are at high risk of substance
abuse. Some Veterans may turn to alcohol and drug use as unhealthy ways of coping
with trauma, anxiety, depression, pain, injuries and other conditions related to their
service. Research has found that 46% of Veterans reported alcohol or substance abuse
during active duty and 42% reported alcohol or drug use after transitioning to civilian
life. 173 Since 2017, a number of initiatives have been spearheaded by VA and Veterans
groups to stem the tide of the opioid crisis among Veterans, including new comprehensive
prescription guidelines and exploring alternatives to using opioids for pain
management. 174, 175 Mindfulness and meditation are a holistic, alternative approach to
positively impact pain centers and reduce stress. 176
An analysis of health insurance claims data published in the online journal BMJ Open
revealed "diseases of despair" such as substance abuse, alcohol dependency and
suicidal thoughts, such behaviors have soared in the United States over the past decade.
Between 2015 and 2017, life expectancy fell in the United States, the longest sustained
decline since 1915-18. Deaths among middle-aged white non-Hispanic men and women
rose sharply between 1999 and 2015. These premature deaths are largely attributable to
accidental overdose, alcohol-related disease and suicide. 177 Despair consists of cognitive,
emotional, behavioral and biological domains. Despair also can permeate social
relationships, networks, institutions and communities. 178
Justice-Involved Veterans
Many Veterans return home from deployments with PTSD or other mental health issues.
They may feel isolated, lonely or misunderstood. Separated from the military "family" with
whom they served, they carry the burden of their service alone and some struggle with

Background and Approach
The Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking (EBP) Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-435,
"Evidence Act") requires cabinet-level agencies including the Department of Veterans
Affairs (VA) to create and use Learning Agendas, Annual Evaluation Plans and Capacity
Assessments. In guidance documents, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
specified requirements for these deliverables.
The Learning Agenda and the Capacity Assessment accompany VA's FY 2022-28
Strategic Plan, per statute and OMB guidance. These two documents are appendices in
the Strategic Plan.
Since the Evidence Act became law in early 2019, the chartered VA Foundations for
Evidence-Based Policymaking Working Group (FEBPWG) has superintended efforts to
meet the statutory requirements of the Evidence Act across VA. The FEBPWG has over
190 representatives from the three VA Administrations (Veterans Benefits Administration
(VBA), Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and the National Cemetery Administration
(NCA)) and Staff Offices supporting implementation of the Evidence Act and EBP
principles more generally. Organizations with expertise in evidence-building and
evaluation, such as VHA's Office of Research and Development (ORD) and its Quality
Enhancement Research Initiative (QUERI), provide critical support to the FEBPWG and
assist other work group member organizations to expand and mature capabilities across
the Department. In turn, the FEBPWG works to advocate on behalf of Veterans issues by
featuring ORD/QUERI's studies in public-facing documents like this Learning Agenda and
to assist in coordinating efforts across VA offices. (See VA's Capacity Assessment for
additional detail regarding VHA's efforts in evidence-building and -use.)
Formal sessions occur monthly with overran average of 50 attendees and members meet
informally in groups several times a week to advance EBP efforts across the enterprise.
In addition to the statutorily required deliverables, the FEBPWG has spearheaded the
development, implementation and successful use of formal, documented evidence-based
best practices (such as strength-of-evidence checklists for use by non-expert program
offices) for legislative proposals and budget formulation.
This is VA's first standalone learning agenda document (although VHA for many years
has used research agendas as evidence-building plans for its health care studies) and it
summarizes the Department's efforts to obtain evidence-based input and insights with
findings across the Administrations and the entire enterprise. This Learning Agenda
represents the views of self-identified practitioners of data analysis/science and program
evaluations.
Topic Selection Criteria
Since the passage of the Evidence Act, VA viewed the opportunity of publicizing its most
significant evaluation and research priorities as consistent with its vital mission on behalf
of Veterans and their families and welcomes the chance to further advocate for them by
focusing attention on important issues.

VA
U.S. Department
of Veterans Affairs
To maximize the value of implementing the Evidence Act provisions on behalf of Veterans
and their families, the VA FEBPWG identified several criteria to determine issues
appropriate for the Learning Agenda.
Criterion #1: Existing Lines of Inquiry
VA's current efforts entail hundreds of program evaluations every year, conducted with a
variety of means and for many reasons, including statutory requirements. In addition,
VHA conducts hundreds of focused evaluations of clinical practices. For the purposes of
the Evidence Act, however, this Learning Agenda and associated Annual Evaluation
Plans focus on evaluations of policies and programs as defined by OMB guidance in M-
20-12. Evaluation practitioners, both in offices focused on research and in program offices
responsible for program implementation, focus on existing lines of inquiry embodied in
current programs and efforts. Practitioners believe that all areas of national importance
currently are being addressed at some point in the evaluation lifecycle.
Moreover, VA seeks to leverage its existing, robust approaches to outreach and in reach
about potential studies, data and findings with its many stakeholders, including peer
experts within the Federal government (i.e., DoD, HHS and HUD), intergovernmental
authorities, the private sector, VSOs and other advocacy and research-based
organizations, including the National Academies. VA's Capacity Assessment documents,
for example, VHA's existing lifecycle for investigations that maximize diverse inputs as to
study topic priorities from across the VA enterprise and elsewhere and which result in
effective dissemination of findings. Specific such requirements in the Evidence Act reflect
VA's thought-leading approach which has developed over decades.
This initial criterion also highlights areas and topics of on-going interest and concern for
which important questions remain to be addressed. Such topics present gaps in
knowledge, processes and practices for which the Learning Agenda will focus attention
within the VA enterprise, with stakeholders, Veterans and the public.
VA evidence-builders, researchers, evaluators and statisticians look forward to using the
dissemination of this Learning Agenda to its many partners to deepen data sharing and
topic identification activities documented in VA's Annual Evaluation Plan.
Criterion #2: Mission-focus on Veterans and their Families
VA faces several challenges with respect to our direct mission-driven care and services,
as well as our administrative functions. However, VA chooses to focus the initial effort
under the Evidence Act on purely Veteran-facing topics. By doing so, efforts to address
the requirements of the Evidence Act will stimulate internal VA interest and external
stakeholder attention, on the most important issues facing Veterans and their families. In
future cycles, VA may choose to expand its focus to include administrative matters such
as hiring, placement of facilities, or improving the efficiency of supply chains.
This Veteran-facing aspect requires VA to highlight important gaps regarding vital issues
for Veterans, such as suicide, homelessness and opioid addiction - areas in which VA
and the rest of government have made substantial progress. However, more needs to be
done, but such action requires knowledge that has yet to be uncovered and confirmed.
Page 134 of 235
VA
U.S. Department
of Veterans Affairs
VA's Learning Agenda therefore focuses on critical gaps in understanding of critical
issues for Veterans and their families.
As is further discussed in the FY 2023 VA Annual Evaluation Plan, evidence-builders and
evaluators are frequently embedded in the same offices which are responsible for
program execution. This characteristic helps to ensure that research priorities are rapidly
identified and acted upon, and the findings can be used quickly to adjust practices,
processes and policies to best serve Veterans. Also, in this way program offices can
rapidly share results with their program and policy collaborators both within VA and
elsewhere. This aspect is vitally important to effectively address urgent issues such as
suicide prevention, opioid use disorder and homelessness. Those investigations
necessary to serve oversight purposes, however, are conducted with greater
independence, often by evaluators in different chains of command.
Criterion #3: Underserved and Vulnerable Veterans
Third, VA's Strategic Plan for FY 2022-28 encompasses myriad areas in which VA
impacts Veterans-every aspect of the life journeys of our Veterans-requiring a focus on
a meaningful subset of our strategic objectives. An immediate consensus emerged in the
FEBPWG and across VA: To rally attention and effort to VA's public evaluation activities
under the Evidence Act we must focus on the most compelling of our objectives which are
enhancing care and services for underserved, vulnerable, at-risk and marginalized
Veterans (e.g., those facing addiction, suicide or homelessness. In early deliberations,
there was no second-place issue that presented so stark a priority.
Criterion #4: Nomination Using Administration's Existing Prioritization
The FEBPWG decided that those individuals who were responsible for carrying out
agendas and plans should use their existing, documented priorities (which align to VA's
Strategic Plan) to nominate a set of questions and research topics for which critical gaps
in knowledge exist. These gaps have been previously identified by VHA and VBA, as they
note in the FY 2023 Annual Evaluation Plan. For the purposes of developing this Learning
Agenda, the Administrations applied their own criteria and these criteria to prioritize them
for inclusion.
Each Administration has its own strategy and business documents that link to the VA
strategic plan, and they are familiar with the most significant issues they face that address
the criteria. VHA enters the Evidence Act process already recognized as a thought leader
in program evaluation and implementation sciences, while VBA begins with a substantial
process-analytic foundation but not one focused heretofore on evaluation. Elsewhere in
VA there are important pockets of strength in statistics and evidence-building, but there is
currently no centralized focus on consistent standards and processes for their work.
Therefore, the most coherent proposals for Learning Agenda topics are from VA's two
major administrations which, although they are at different maturity levels in evaluation
sciences, are the foci for impactful efforts.
This federated approach ensures that policymakers can obtain the most salient findings
addressing the most significant issues they are likely to face, while the Administrations
pursue questions, they can address in the timeframe of this Learning Agenda and the
associated Annual Evaluation Plans using the current and likely state of knowledge,
Page 135 of 235
VA
U.S. Department
of Veterans Affairs
expertise and analytic capacity they encompass. VA seeks to ensure that findings from
specific evidence-building efforts are available to policymakers as soon as they are
available to effectively inform decisions, rather than waiting for more evidence to become
certain. The federated approach across VA organizations and across evaluations and
other evidence-building efforts provides multiple channels for findings to inform decisions.
For example, VHA's long-range plan goals are aligned with overall VA goals for
improvement and modernization of Veteran health services and strengthening VHA as a
high-reliability organization:
Make VHA the provider and care coordinator of choice for Veterans;
Deliver comprehensive and integrated whole health care;
Innovate as a learning and teaching organization; and
Increase the effective and efficient use of resources across the enterprise.
Learning Agenda Topics
This Learning Agenda presents VA's specific approaches to identify priority Learning
Agenda business or policy questions. Using the term "business" implies that evidence-
builders and evaluators are to address not only strictly policy questions-"what" VA
should be doing-but also administrative and process issues the resolution of which may
be essential to making decisions about policy and management issues-"how" VA is
doing business. During FEBPWG's deliberations, VA prioritized evidence-building to
address VA's FY 2022-28 Strategic Plan, Strategic Goal 2: "VA delivers timely,
accessible, high-quality benefits, care and services to meet the unique needs of Veterans
and all eligible beneficiaries," with an emphasis on underserved, vulnerable, at-risk and
marginalized Veterans. VA's Learning Agenda questions derive directly from this priority.
The Administrations were asked to identify the significant business or policy questions
related to such Veterans whose evidence-building findings would be decisive for major
policy questions and to do so using existing and expected knowledge, skills and abilities,
as well as existing and expected financial resources.
VBA and VHA addressed the following areas for each topic:
Section I: Learning Agenda Questions
Section II: Background and Context
Section III: Required and Existing Evidence
Section IV: Evidence Gaps
Section V: Plan for Progress and Risks
Section VI: Attestation of Available Resources
The Learning Agenda business questions share a focus on medjum-term resolution
associated with the time horizon of strategic planning rather than urgent responses to
emergent issues. Therefore, topics of immediate consequence, such as those concerning
the acute phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, are not included, although VA remains
focused on robustly and expeditiously addressing such concerns and in the case of the
Page 136 of 235
VA
U.S. Department
of Veterans Affairs
COVID-19 pandemic, the FY 2023 Annual Evaluation Plan addresses the longer-term
impacts of it on patients, practitioners and healthcare systems. Likewise, VA studies
multigenerational variables, but in the context of a 6-year cycle that will focus on the
medium-term subset of larger issues.
VBA Learning Agenda
VBA's Learning Agenda has a significant focus on military-to-civilian transitions due to the
identification of significant research needs in this area. This need was identified by a
recent literature review by VHA which included academic articles, Congressional
testimony, VA project documentation from the Transition Assistance Program (TAP) and
reports from oversight organizations such as GAO, which focused on topics such as
military-to-civilian transition; integration and reintegration into civilian social structures;
transition stress; community reintegration and support structures; identity and military
culture; engagement of Service members and Veterans; and user-oriented design.
Many of the studies reviewed took a qualitative data-gathering approach that involved
interviewing small sets of recently transitioned Service members and Veterans to gather
direct information about experiences and insights into areas for further research with
expanded populations. In addition to explorations of transition within the United States,
the literature review included research and studies conducted with transitioning members
of the Canadian military and peacekeeping forces, as the Life After Service Survey
(LASS) program5 provides valuable insight on the transition process generally. The
review particularly emphasized literature pertaining to Service members and Veterans
who serve or have served post 9/11, as these Veterans became civilians relatively
recently, and their experiences allow a timely look at the transition process.
In this analysis, VBA discovered the need for additional research focused on the transition
needs of younger and female Veterans, whose experiences introduce challenges that
differ from other Veterans. The review also identified the need to better understand the
applicability of skills obtained from the military experience within the civilian context.
Additionally identified needs related to the importance of research which included
transitioning Service members as a family unit both pre-and post-separation.
Service members who are transitioning from military to civilian life often experience a
variety of challenges, including residential moves and adjusting to new surroundings; new
jobs or potential periods of unemployment; and changes in household makeup. Often
these changes evoke significant uncertainty in the lives of Veterans, prompting potential
unease and anxiety, which can have significant repercussions on their financial situation
and emotional well-being.
To fully address the expanding needs of returning and transitioning Veterans, a more
holistic examination beyond the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is
warranted. 181 Numerous studies have identified the prevalence of diagnosed PTSD as
having an upper bound of 19% and even this number is questionable due to the quality of
181 Mobbs MC, Bonanno GA. Beyond war and PTSD: The crucial role of transition stress in the lives of
military veterans. Clin Psychology Review 2018, 59:137-144.
Page 137 of 235

of Veterans Affairs
the studies. 182 Most importantly, studies have linked individuals who experience transition
stress to those who seek treatment for mental and physical health challenges, including
suicidal ideation. This group includes Veterans not formally diagnosed with PTSD. 183, 184
A more holistic view of military-to-civilian transition is necessary to understand the factors
that contribute to transition challenges and determine the effectiveness of VBA programs
to aid Veterans with adjustment to civilian life.
Research indicates that 27% of Veterans state that they struggled with re-entry into
civilian life; this number jumps to 44% when the focus is on post-9/11 Veterans. 185 VBA,
as part of its Post-Separation Transition Assistance Program (PSTAP) Assessment
Outcomes Study Report, identified that over 60% of Veterans surveyed, who participated
in the program, agreed or strongly agreed that "The process of transitioning from active
duty was more challenging than I expected.' "186 Military-to-civilian transition challenges
extend beyond PTSD-related concerns. The increased focus on transition stress involves
framing that stress and the associated benefits, services and treatments that can help to
address it, as a normal part of the transition process.
There are many programs associated with providing support to Veterans and span across
organizational boundaries. Within VBA, Outreach, Transition and Economic Development
(OTED) has primary responsibility for identifying and addressing post-separation goals of
the military-to-civilian transition process, of which a key component is TAP. The modern
TAP was established in 1991 to ease the transition of Service members who were
involuntarily separated from the military. The program has evolved to serve all eligible
transitioning Service members in their transition from military to civilian life with the
institution of the Veterans Opportunity to Work (VOW) to Hire Heroes Act of 2011, Public
Law (P.L.) 112-56. 187
Military-to-Civilian Readiness Research Paper: The Past, Present and Future of the
Transition Process
In 2020, VBA commissioned a research paper, using data gathered from human-centered
design studies and strategic assessments that were previously completed.

It examined existing research gathered via a literature review focused on readiness for
the shift to civilian life to describe the current transition experience and underscore gaps
in the existing process. VBA is continuing to expand the research scope, engage
Veterans on their transition concerns and analyze data from internal and external sources
to identify additional topics relevant to the transition process. The paper identified topics
for future inquiry related to factors that involve, among others, the transition challenges for
younger and female Veterans, examining Veterans and their families simultaneously, or
as a family unit, both pre- and post-separation and developing a framework for evaluating
the efficacy of institutions that promote "Veteran-friendly" programs. 188
In addition, VBA currently is analyzing the results of the PSTAP study to validate these
findings to determine if additional research is necessary.
Section I: Learning Agenda Questions
To develop its learning questions and approaches robustly, VBA held an agency-wide
elicitation of learning questions. To aid its Lines of Business and Staff Offices (LOB/SO)
in developing its earning questions, VBA hosted trainings that were designed to guide the
development of questions and approaches, as well as providing consultative assistance
during the developmental process.
VBA chose a decision support approach in its Learning Agenda development by guiding
the LOB/SO through exercises designed to determine key questions across four major
domains: strategy, policy, resource allocation and program operations. In this manner,
VBA believes that focusing evidence on needed leadership decision can improve the
quality of decision-making and impart the importance of building evidence in all its
programs and operations.
VBA also developed a template (Appendix A) to standardize submissions and help to
ensure quality.
Administration leadership then carefully reviewed each submission and selected a subset
for this Learning Agenda. VBA will review and track key Learning Questions submitted via
internal management review. VBA is developing a monitoring and tracking approach at
the enterprise level to examine elements of timeliness, completeness and quality of each
Learning Agenda topic.
VBA used a structured template (Appendix A) to support the development of its learning
questions. Following are the five learning questions grouped under three high-level
categories as follows:
1. Learning questions focused on underserved and vulnerable Veterans:
a. Are there observed differences in the access to and administration of Pension
benefits for underserved communities?
b. To what extent will climate change and the financial risks it introduces affect the
Home Loan Program, and what changes would better integrate climate-related

financial risks into VA policies and financial management to mitigate financial
risks?
C. Can Disability Benefits Questionnaires (DBQs) be updated to improve data
capture capabilities for tracking at-risk Veterans with a reported level of risk for
suicide?
2. Learning question focused on the Military-to-Civilian transition process:
a. To what extent is VA's Transition Assistance Program supporting the transition
needs of newly separated Veterans?
3. Learning question focused on both underserved Veterans and the Military-to-
Civilian transition process:
a. How can VBA, working together with VHA and other stakeholders, better
understand when MST survivors are not optimally served and/or negatively
impacted when interacting with VBA?
Following are the detailed descriptions of the learning questions along with information
regarding alignment with VA FY 2022-28 Strategic Plan, background, evidence needed,
plan for progress, risks associated and attestation of available resources.
VBA Learning Agenda Question 1a: Equity Assessment-Advancing Equity to
Underserved Populations
Section I: Learning Agenda Question
"Are there observed differences in the access to and administration of Pension benefits
for underserved communities?
Alignment to VA FY 2022-28 Strategic Plan
Objective 2.3: (Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, Accessibility (I-DEA))

outcomes, experiences and quality of life.
Communities
Section II: Background and Context
This question was submitted by the Pension and Fiduciary Service/ 21PF. The VA
Pension program provides monthly benefits payments to wartime Veterans who meet
certain age or disability requirements and who have income and net worth within certain
limits. The purpose of this learning question is to understand if there are observed
differences in the access to and administration of Pension benefits for underserved
communities (as defined by section 2(b) within Executive Order 13985, Advancing Racial
Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government) and,
if so, altering policies and procedures with the goal of eliminating differences. The
question falls under the categories of "Theory of Change" and "Foundational Research."
Scope is both "Strategic" and "Operational".
Page 140 of 235
VA
U.S. Department
of Veterans Affairs
Section III: Required and Existing Evidence
Evidence needed can be categorized as data related to "Policy Analysis" and "Program
Evaluation." Data needed consists of communication methods; number of Pension
applicants; number of Pension recipients; reasons for denial of Pension benefits; and
demographic data on Pension applicants and recipients. The data identified is maintained
by VA's Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) and the VA/DoD Identity Repository.
Section IV: Evidence Gaps
Current Veteran demographic data on benefits recipients are not comprehensive enough
to use for many types of studies that could address a Learning Agenda question. VBA
collects some age, education, gender, income and physical location data in the Annual
Benefits Report, but only some race/ethnicity data. Also, items such as familial status,
housing status, sexual orientation and gender identity are not identified. As a way to
mitigate these previous areas of data limitations, VBA will incorporate additional data
sources and demographic categories as needed based on an analysis of its current data.
Section V: Plan for Progress and Risks
VBA's Pension and Fiduciary Service plans to use existing data and create supplemental
data through use of other data or data protocols (e.g., to identify demographics for
population being examined). Demographic variable may include race, ethnicity, gender,
age and location. VBA will work with internal and external specialists to identify ways to
supplement extant data.
Section VI: Attestation of Available Resources
Resources are included within the current staffing/full time equivalent (FTE) plan.
VBA Learning Agenda Question 1b: Impact of Climate Change on VA Home Loan
Program - identify climate-related financial risks to the VA Home Loan Program and
integrate climate-related financial risk into program management and identify or make
changes to the program to mitigate climate-related financial risk.
Section I: Learning Agenda Question
"To what extent will climate change and the financial risks it introduces affect the Home
Loan Program and what changes would better integrate climate-related financial risks into
VA policies and financial management to mitigate financial risks?"
Alignment to VA FY 2022-28 Strategic Plan
Objective 4.4: (Evidence Based Decisions) VA will improve governance, management
practices and make evidence-based
FY 2022-28 Strategic Plan
decisions to ensure quality outcomes and
experiences and efficient use of resources.
4.4.6: Climate Change
Section II: Background and Context
VA, and particularly the Loan Guaranty Service (LGY), from a policy and financial
perspective, wishes to understand how it could adjust aspects of the VA Home Loan
Page 141 of 235
VA
U.S. Department
of Veterans Affairs
Program and its risk management framework so that LGY can adapt to impacts of climate
change. In considering such adjustments, LGY must be able to not only understand the
impact to Veterans and taxpayers but must also understand the impact of any changes on
the secondary market to ensure the VA-guaranteed loan remains a marketable product.
Question type is "Foundational research."
Section III: Required and Existing Evidence
The Evidence types of "Research" and "Policy analysis" will be used. The types of
evidence are identified in Section V.
Section IV: Evidence Gaps
Current Veteran demographic data on benefits recipients are not comprehensive enough
to use for many types of studies that could address a Learning Agenda question. VBA
collects some age, education, gender, income and physical location data in the Annual
Benefits Report, but only some race/ ethnicity data. Also, items such as familial status,
housing status, sexual orientation and gender identity are not identified. VBA will publish
any additional data elements received into existing reporting.
In addition to the evidence gaps related to demographic factors, VA LGY also will be
incorporating the work as related to the EO13040 Section 5(c) Task Force.
There is insufficient market analysis; LGY is relying on the contract as outlined in
Sections V and VI, to provide data to help drive decisions.
Section V: Plan for Progress and Risks
LGY lacks the historical and current market analysis to make any changes currently.
Therefore, LGY, sought out and accepted a contract that will provide them with the
necessary data and recommendations based on the analysis. Evaluation would then be
the method.
LGY will analyze the data to determine what changes might be made to the program and
its risk management framework and policies to adapt to climate change. LGY also will
assess whether the impact of these possible changes would be positive or negative for
key stakeholders, including borrowers, taxpayers/the Government, the housing market,
etc.
Once LGY completes its assessment of what changes might be incorporated into its
policies and/or legal authorities it will develop a plan to update systems and to
communicate changes to its stakeholders and staff.
Anticipated challenges: How would policy decisions to better manage or mitigate
climate-related risks affect access to the home loan benefit?
What financial impact does climate change have on the 3.5M active loans in the
portfolio?
How would policy decisions to better-manage or mitigate climate-related risks affect
the home loan program's cost to taxpayers?
Page 142 of 235
VA
U.S. Department
of Veterans Affairs
What decisions are external stakeholders making about investing in VA loans and
what decisions are lenders making about borrowers (credit, capacity, collateral and
capital)?
Section VI: Attestation of Available Resources
The external contract to conduct a review of available data is funded and any required
enhancements to systems/future enhancements would be addressed during the formal
budget process.
VBA Learning Agenda Question 1c: Disability Benefits Questionnaires (DBQs)
Section I: Learning Agenda Question
"Can Disability Benefits Questionnaires (DBQs) be updated to improve data capture
capabilities for tracking at-risk Veterans with a reported level of risk for suicide?'
Alignment to VA FY 2022-28 Strategic Plan
Objective 2.1: (Underserved, marginalized
FY 2022-28 Strategic Plan
and at-risk Veterans) VA emphasizes the
delivery of benefits, care and services to
2.1.1: Mental Health
underserved, marginalized and at-risk
and Suicide Prevention
Veterans to prevent suicide and
homelessness, improve their economic
security, health, resiliency and quality of life
and achieve equity.
Section II: Background and Context
VBA's Medical Disability Examinations Office (MDEO) seeks to explore DBQs, update
options for XSD driven data capture that could allow for tracking of at-risk Veterans with a
reported level of high acute (defined) and intermediate acute (defined) risk for suicide.
Data traceability is the ability to ensure that collected data is completely "findable" across
the entire landscape. Learning question type is "Foundational Research"-Seeking a
better understanding of a technical capability/technology. Scope is "Operational."
Section III: Required and Existing Evidence
MDEO expects this foundational review to include an exploration of the current state of
the ability for DBQs to identify at-risk Veterans, identify advances in data collection and
mining abilities (data traceability) that are the result of on-going collaborative creation and
implementation efforts by MDEO and the Office of Automated Benefit Delivery (ABD), and
the relational information regarding currently available at-risk Veteran data. As part of that
foundational review, MDEO expects to collect information that will allow for an
assessment of the potential impacts DBQ updates may create regarding improvement in
capturing related data and data traceability of at-risk Veterans.
MDEO currently collaborates with ABD on DBQ related data improvement efforts (i.e.,
DBQ content and format, data schemas and information defined in the DBQ Information
Exchange Package Documentation (IEPD) with associated data validations, collection,
and reporting functionality). Therefore, data and evidence review for this purpose would
Page 143 of 235
VA
U.S. Department
of Veterans Affairs
be minimal, as the mechanisms for review are currently in place and would require limited
expansion.
Section IV: Evidence Gaps
Current Veteran demographic data on benefits recipients are not comprehensive enough
to use for many types of studies that could address a Learning Agenda question. VBA
collects some age, education, gender, income and physical location data in the Annual
Benefits Report, but only some race/ ethnicity data. Also, items such as familial status,
housing status, sexual orientation and gender identity are not identified.
Mitigation strategy-MDEC expects the foundational review will result in identification of
gaps in information that could allow a decision to be made regarding the feasibility of
leveraging the DBQ medical data and Veteran specific metadata that is captured as a
result of the XSD/IEPD-based responses, in addition to other existing VA approved
sources, that may potentially allow for appropriate data mining and traceability across VA
systems. The review aims to determine if DBQ updates can be used, with acceptable risk
mitigation, to improve our ability to identify more accurate populations, data sets, etc.
Section V: Plan for Progress and Risks
MDEO will utilize the foundational review design to explore the current state of, to include
existing information and gaps, as well as planned improvements to, such as the work
underway in collaboration with the Office of Automated Benefit Delivery (ABD), data
collection techniques to determine the feasibility of utilizing DBQ updates to contribute to
VA's capacity to track at-risk Veterans.
Once MDEO completes the foundational review, it will communicate collaboratively with
all VA stakeholders and offices, identified as part of the foundational review, to review and
assess outcomes and initiate decision-making processes to determine actions needed, if
any.
Anticipated challenges: Any delay to MDEO's current multi-year planning and VBA IT
Investment Roadmap, especially the XSD mapping plans, will hinder the ability to
complete the research.
Section VI: Attestation of Available Resources
Resources are included in current multi-year planning and VBA IT Investment Roadmap.
VBA Learning Agenda Question 2a: Evaluation of Transition Assistance Program
Section I: Learning Agenda Question
"To what extent is VA's Transition Assistance Program (TAP) supporting the transition
needs of newly separated Veterans?"

Alignment to VA FY 2022-28 Strategic Plan
Objective 2.1: (Underserved, Marginalized
and At-Risk Veterans) VA emphasizes the
FY 2022-28 Strategic Plan
delivery of benefits, care and services to
Strategy 2.1.7: Military

Objective 2.2: (Tailored delivery of benefits, care and services ensure equity and
access) VA and partners will tailor delivery of benefits and customize whole health care
and services for the recipient at each phase of their life journey, including end of life, to
ensure equity and address their unique needs, preferences, challenges and goals.
Military-to-Civilian Transition complements two strategies in the FY 2022-28 Strategic
Plan. Implementing Strategy 2.1.7 is specific to the Military-to-Civilian Transition: VA and
partners provides holistic assessments and transition support to understand "economic
well-being" for all transitioning Service members, Veterans, their families and caregivers
to improve their economic security, health and quality of life outcomes. Implementing
Strategy 2.2.6 regarding job readiness and placement for Service members and
transitioned Veterans, "VA promotes the building of high-performing partnerships to
enhance Veteran job-readiness and placement.' VBA's Learning Agenda and strategies
2.1.7 and 2.2.6 will work together to build high-performing partnerships that ensure a
seamless transition from military service to civilian life and promote long-term economic
security for Veterans.
Section II: Background and Context
OTED's VA TAP is a one-day course called VA Benefits and Services. Led by VA
Benefits Advisors, the course helps transitioning Service members understand how to
navigate VA and the benefits and services they have earned through their military career.
The course offers interactive exercises, real examples and covers important topics like
family support, disability compensation, education and health care benefits. Purpose of
the question is to evaluate the effectiveness of TAP and to identify any gaps and inform
future improvements. Question types can be categorized as "Theory of Change" to
ensure VA TAP is achieving the desired outcomes and "Foundational Research" to better
understand the transitioning population and their needs. Scope is "Strategic" and
"Programmatic" to allow VBA to meet its strategic objectives vis-a-vis transition and make
improvements to the programs and activities in the transition space.
Section III: Required and Existing Evidence
Currently, VBA is in the third year of a multi-year analysis known as the Post-Separation
Transition Assistance Program Assessment (PSTAP) Outcomes Study. The PSTAP is
comprised of two separate survey instruments currently in use (initial study launched in
June of 2019) used to assess TAP as well as provide holistic feedback and information
used to improve transition and other VA activities.

1. Annual cross-sectional survey of three cohorts that provides a point-in-time set of
results across the post-separation space.
2. Annual longitudinal survey of Veterans that "opt-in" to be part of a longer-term
study from cross-sectional survey that provides trends over time and more focused
investigation. PSTAP reports are located at: VBA's PSTAP Reports.
The PSTAP uses various analytical methods to develop the reports/findings, such as
statistical modeling and regression analysis on various sections to determine the relative
importance and weight of the information to Veterans. Regression analysis is conducted
to identify which courses have the most impact on increasing satisfaction with TAP. An
additional regression model is run on the entire respondent population to identify possible
demographic differences that may influence satisfaction with TAP. To understand the
factors that have a significant impact on the transition of Veterans to civilian employment
and their relationship to TAP, a statistical model was built using logistic regression. The
model analyzed which challenges were most impactful to Veterans' overall satisfaction
with TAP using the question: "Overall, the program was beneficial in helping me gain the
information and skills I needed to prepare me for my transition and post-military life."
Section IV: Evidence Gaps
Current Veteran demographic data on benefits recipients are not comprehensive enough
to use for many types of studies that could address a Learning Agenda question. VBA
collects some age, education, gender, income and physical location data in the Annual
Benefits Report, but only some race/ ethnicity data. Also, items such as familial status,
housing status, sexual orientation and gender identity are not identified. Mitigation
strategy-VBA will incorporate additional data sources and demographic categories as
needed based on an analysis of its current data. New data will come from a variety of
internal and external sources, including but not limited to various sections of Public Law
116-315, Johnny Isakson and David P. Roe, M.D. Veterans Health Care and Benefits
Improvement Act Of 2020. Specifically, VBA will incorporate data from section 4305, One-
Year Independent Assessment of the Effectiveness of Transition Assistance Program,
and section 4306, Longitudinal Study on Changes to Transition Assistance Program of
the law. In addition, the PSTAP assessments are revised as required and new
administrative data from VA, DoD and other external partners are added to the analysis in
an ongoing manner and also will be included as they become available.
Factors contributing to the lower life satisfaction scores of African Americans surveyed
were captured through the PSTAP Outcomes study. Mitigation strategy-VBA is
determining the priority Learning Agenda question or questions needed and the evidence-
building strategies needed to answer them. VBA is conducting a root cause analysis to
determine what factors may contribute to this outcome.
There is insufficient understanding of the application of skills and attributes gained in the
military-to-civilian work-life balance in the years following discharge from military service.

Services to gain access to the Directory of New Hires and examine the data.
Section V: Plan for Progress and Risks
The PSTAP Assessment consists of two surveys. Those surveys are the Cross-Sectional
Survey and the Longitudinal Survey. The Cross-Sectional Survey annually collects
information on Veterans who separated 6 months, 12 months and 36 months prior to
survey deployment. The survey included 55 questions in 2021. The topics covered by the
questions included participation in TAP classes, perceived utility of TAP classes
completed by the Veteran and multiple post-transition outcomes organized by subject
area. The post-transition outcomes contained five life domains: (1) employment, (2)
education, (3) health and relationships, (4) financial circumstances and (5) general
satisfaction and well-being. The survey also included two general open-ended response
questions that provided Veterans an opportunity to share thoughts about the TAP classes
and their transition.
The Longitudinal Survey explores the long-term outcomes of Veterans who completed the
Cross-Sectional Survey and approved their participation in the Longitudinal Survey. The
Longitudinal Survey includes all three cohorts from the 2019 Cross-Sectional Survey and
adds a single cohort (the 6-month cohort) from each subsequent Cross-Sectional Survey.
The survey included 57 questions in 2021. It covered topics including perceptions of the
utility of the VA TAP Benefits and Services briefings, challenges during the transition
process, employment status, education, health and financial status and life satisfaction.
Survey questions, when applicable, mirrored the Cross-Sectional Survey to allow for trend
analysis in the long-term study. The survey also included one open-ended question to
allow Veterans to provide additional insight into their lives over the past 12 months.
The PSTAP study invites approximately 165 thousand participants from the target time
from separation for the cross-sectional portion and approximately 10 thousand for the
longitudinal. The longitudinal participants will increase each year as another cohort is
added from the previous year's cross sectional. Participants are provided with a postcard
invite to take the survey online, periodic email reminders throughout the execution phase.
The survey data is combined with VA and DoD administrative data to build the holistic
profile of the respondents and analysis is conducted across all the life domains, outcomes
and TAP assessment.
Regression analysis is conducted to identify which courses have the most impact on
increasing satisfaction with TAP. An additional regression model is run on the entire
respondent population to identify possible demographic differences that may influence
satisfaction with TAP. To understand the factors that have a significant effect on the
transition of Veterans to civilian employment and their relationship to TAP, a statistical
model was built using logistic regression. The model analyzed which challenges were
most impactful to Veterans' overall satisfaction with TAP using the statement: "Overall,
the program was beneficial in helping me gain the information and skills I needed to
prepare me for my transition and post-military life."

VBA Learning Agenda Question 3a: Understanding Military Sexual Trauma (MST)
Survivor Experience
Section I: Learning Agenda Question
"How can VBA, working together with VHA and other stakeholders, better understand
when MST survivors are not optimally served and/or negatively impacted when interacting
with VBA?"
Alignment to VA FY 2022-28 Strategic Plan
Objective 1.2: (Lifelong Relationships and

caregivers, survivors, Service members,
Strategy 1.2.1: (Improved
employees and other stakeholders to project
Understanding)
future trends, anticipate needs and deliver
effective and agile solutions that improve their
outcomes, access and experiences.
Section II: Background and Context
VBA's Strategic Program Management Office (SPMO) seeks to understand MST survivor
experience. Strategic Goal-Trust; Veterans trust VBA to deliver benefits that enable
success throughout their lives. How can VBA, in coordination with VHA and other
stakeholders, better identify perceived and actual pain points (i.e., understand when MST
survivors are not optimally served and/or negatively impacted when interacting with VA).
At its initial stage the question falls under the category of "Foundational Research" (to
gain a better understanding of the MST survivor population) leading to "Scenario
Planning" to understand approaches that better address pain points experienced when
MST survivors interact with VA. Scope is "Strategic."
Section III: Required and Existing Evidence
The evidence types are combination of "Research" and "Policy Analysis. Required
evidence includes the demographics of MST survivors; DoD information on Service
member MST survivors' pain points; VHA data on interaction with MST survivors; and
public data on survivors of sexual assault. Available data sources include qualitative and
quantitative MST data gathered from Veteran's surveys (VSignals), internal stakeholder
interviews (e.g., MST coordinators) and publications. In addition, journey mapping will be
employed as a methodological approach to build foundational evidence, through survivor
interviews, on MST survivors' pain points and bright spots regarding their claims
experience.

Section IV: Evidence Gaps
Current Veteran demographic data on benefits recipients are not comprehensive enough
to use for many types of studies that could address a Learning Agenda question. VBA
collects some age, education, gender, income and physical location data in the Annual
Benefits Report, but only some race/ ethnicity data. Also, items such as familial status,
housing status, sexual orientation and gender identity are not identified. VBA will
incorporate existing qualitative and quantitative MST data gathered from Veteran's
surveys (VSignals), internal stakeholder interviews (MST coordinators, Veteran's Survey
Officers), web forums, publications and journals into existing VBA data repositories and
make available through existing High-Impact Service Provider reports.
There is insufficient understanding of the application of skills and attributes gained in the
military-to-civilian work-life balance in the years following discharge from military service.
Mitigation strategy-VBA is determining the priority learning question or questions
needed and the evidence-building strategies needed to answer them.
Improved data on length of military-to-civilian unemployment timeframes. Mitigation
strategy-VBA is in the process of working with the Department of Health and Human
Services to gain access to the Directory of New Hires and examine the data.
Section V: Plan for Progress and Risks
Methods to be used are human centered design, journey mapping, customer persona
development and statistical analyses. Results will be documented in a structured manner
and made available through targeted stakeholder briefings to organizations in VA. As
appropriate, VBA will work closely with Office of Executive Review (OER) and Office of
Congressional and Legislative Affairs (OCLA) to disseminate the information to public
forums and to Congressional oversight bodies. Data will be controlled and secured in
accordance with VA Data Governance directives and VA policy.
Anticipated challenges: Maintaining appropriate Confidentiality of Data. Given the highly
sensitive nature of the topic, care will be taken in terms of identification of interview
subjects and data collection/dissemination methods. Coordination among stakeholders.
Stakeholders from across VA (potential external stakeholders) will require them to commit
resources. Availability of SPMO capacity: To achieve valuable results, SPMO will need to
ensure appropriate resources are available.
Section VI: Attestation of Available Resources
VBA will work in concert with Veterans Experience Office (VEO) and VHA, leveraging
resources already allocated. A need to justify out-year resources may be required.
Section V: General Challenges
VBA identified in its Learning Agenda questions, challenges specific to the questions
submitted. In addition, VBA recognizes the following challenges as general in nature to
addressing the Learning Agenda questions:
1. Tracking outcomes of Veterans after completion of benefits. VBA has established
communication modes with Veterans while they are applying for a claim or
participating in benefits programs. Collecting data regarding the outcomes on
Page 149 of 235
VA
U.S. Department
of Veterans Affairs
Veterans' lives post-benefits delivery will provide insight into the long-term benefits
of programs. Developing the communications approach and data collection
methods for tracking these outcomes requires effort and resources.
2. Increasing internal understanding of the need to examine Veteran outcomes. As
identified in its initial capacity assessment, VBA currently captures and uses
evidence to improve operational processes including claims processing. VBA is
building the communications and change management needed to build evidence to
assess the outcomes and impact of programs.
3. Developing or gaining access to data of Veterans who do not use VBA programs.
Veterans who might be underserved by VBA-those who earned benefits but have
not taken advantage of them-may have no or limited connection to VBA. VBA
must develop the means to understand this population as a way to build evidence.
VHA Learning Agenda
Section I: Learning Agenda Questions
VHA will pursue five Learning Agenda questions/topics with focused studies for each. The
questions are:
1. What are the ways VA can ensure Veterans have access to timely care in their
preferred setting? (Access to Care pursuant to VA Strategic Goal 2, Objectives 2.1,
2.2 and 2.3.)
2. What are the ways VHA can provide clinically appropriate pain management to
Veterans while simultaneously decreasing dependence on opioids? (Pain
Management & Opioids pursuant to VA Strategic Goal 2, Objective 2.4.)
3. What strategies work best to prevent suicide among Veterans? (Suicide Prevention
pursuant to VA Strategic Goal 2, Objectives 2.1 and 2.4.)
4. To what extent have military environmental exposures during their period of
service harmed Veterans, especially regarding latent or chronic adverse health
effects? (Environmental Exposure pursuant to VA Strategic Goal 2, Objective 2.4.)
5. What are the best strategies to implement state of the art evaluation and care
models to provide effective care for Veterans exposed to toxic burn pit smoke and
other military-related airborne hazards? (Environmental Exposure pursuant to VA
Strategic Goal 2, Objective 2.4.)
How Learning Agenda Questions Were Chosen
VHA, primarily through ORD and Quality Enhancement Research Initiative (QUERI), uses
a lifecycle that was created in 2019 to identify top health care priorities based on the ORD
goal of enhancing the substantial real-world impact of research. QUERI further adapted
the lifecycle per request from the VHA Governance Board and input from FEBPWG to
formalize a process for prioritizing, deploying and reporting on Learning Agenda goals
and updating evidence-building activities and evaluation plans on a regular basis.
Specifically, QUERI identifies learning agenda questions, evidence building activities and
Page 150 of 235
VA
U.S. Department
of Veterans Affairs
evaluation plans based on multiple sources of stakeholder input (see Figure 1). On
occasion, Congress will mandate a priority through legislation or appropriation. Priorities
that lead to evidence-building activities including evaluation plans also then undergo
standardized peer review processes to ensure independence and integrity of findings.
The process begins with solicitation of top national evaluation priorities from multi-level
stakeholders. Then QUERI, after aligning priorities with VA and VHA strategic goals,
releases a request for applications from investigators to operationalize Learning Agenda
goals, notably through evidence-building activities and annual evaluation plans.
Independent expert reviewers who are determined to be without conflict of interest are
assigned to each plan and score and critique them. Certain evidence-building activities
and evaluations are approved as high-quality evaluations (approximately 50%) and
receive funding; funding decisions are based on the overall quality of the proposal,
alignment with priorities and availability of funds. These evaluations are expected to
publish results in scientific peer-reviewed journals, which are subsequently tracked in
PubMed (National Library of Medicine).

VHA Learning Agenda Question 1: Access to Care
Section I: Learning Agenda Question
What are the ways VA can ensure Veterans have access to timely care in their preferred
setting?
Alignment to VA FY 2022-28 Strategic Plan
Objective 2.1: (Underserved, marginalized
FY 2022-28 Strategic Plan
and at-risk Veterans) VA emphasizes the
delivery of benefits, care and services to
Strategy 2.1.8: Rural Health
underserved, marginalized and at-risk
Strategy 2.2.3: Telehealth/
Veterans to prevent suicide and
Connected Care
homelessness, improve their economic
security, health, resiliency and quality of life
Strategy 2.3.1: Equity to
and achieve equity.
Underserved Communities
Objective 2.2: (Tailored delivery of benefits, care and services ensure equity and
access) VA and partners will tailor delivery of benefits and customize whole health care
and services for the recipient at each phase of their life journey.
Objective 2.3: (Inclusion, diversity, equity, accessibility (I-DEA)) VA will leverage
research studies, innovation and partnerships to enhance understanding of Veteran
needs and eliminate disparities and barriers to health, improve service delivery and
opportunities to enhance Veterans' outcomes, experiences and quality of life.
VHA Learning Agenda Question 1 (Access to Care) aligns to three strategies in the FY
2022-28 Strategic Plan. Implementing Strategy 2.1.8 addresses access to care for rural
Veterans, "VA increases access to virtual and in-home health care and promotes Federal
and community care solutions to improve well-being for Veterans in underserved rural
areas." Implementing Strategy 2.2.3 is specific to telehealth and connected care for all
Veterans, "Transformative virtual health technologies and devices deliver convenient,
anytime and anyplace access to the care Veteran's need, when and where they need it."
Finally, Implementing Strategy 2.3.1 is regarding equity to marginalized and underserved
communities, "Policies and programs address persistent, systemic inequity and barriers to
benefits, care, memorialization and services for marginalized and underserved
communities to strengthen the experience and improve outcomes for all Veterans."
Section II: Background and Context
Most Veterans who are enrolled in VHA care live in areas with limited access to health
care services. The VA Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated
Outside Networks (MISSION) Act of 2018 189, 190 with increased investments in VHA's
telemedicine infrastructure, has increased timely Veteran access to care, particularly for
189
Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act of 2014, Pub. L. No. 113-146, STAT. 1754 (2014)).
190 VA MISSION Act of 2018, Pub. L. No. 115-182, STAT. 2372 (2018).

those in underserved regions. Since 2014, VA has seen an increase of 3.4 million
appointments and reported over 58 million appointments at VA facilities in FY 2019. 191
Efforts to obtain decisive evidence in this area will be ongoing with no end date. Rather,
each year VHA will learn more about VHA's supply of health care, Veterans' demand for
health care and the best approaches to address both.
VA will conduct three studies to build evidence for the access to care Learning Agenda
question:
[Note: Each study described below presents its own sections on existing/required
evidence and evidence gaps, while the risks and their mitigation for this part of the
Learning Agenda are common to the three studies.]
1.1 VA MISSION Act of 2018 Section 401 Underserved Facilities & Populations
Sections III & IV: Required and Existing Evidence & Evidence Gaps
Approximately 16% of Veterans live within primary care shortage areas and 70.2% live in
mental health care shortage areas. 192 To address this issue VHA's Office for Veterans
Access to Care (OVAC), in collaboration with other research and operations offices,
developed scoring algorithms to identify underserved VA medical facilities in both primary
care and mental health services. 193 The algorithms are used to update an annual list of
underserved facilities, using data collected from VHA data warehouses and community-
based sources like the Area Health Resources File. Annually, the top twenty underserved
facilities must develop action plans explaining how they will improve Veteran access to
care. Future evaluations will more explicitly study the impacts of MISSION 401 on
underserved subpopulations and historically marginalized communities (e.g., women
Veterans, Veterans of color, rural Veterans), assessing what demographic information is
currently available and how resources may be allocated to address gaps and inequities in
service.
Section V: Plan for Progress and Risks
In 2019, OVAC submitted the first annual report to Congress that included the action
plans from the top seven underserved facilities. The facilities centered their mitigation
strategies in three areas: personnel-focused (recruit and retain high-need providers),
telehealth-focused (increase telehealth capacity) and infrastructure-focused (increase
physical space, as needed). OVAC and its partners will track a variety of metrics
constructed using administrative data and site visits and interviews to evaluate the
effectiveness of these mitigation strategies at addressing facility-level underservedness.
VA will use regression models to control for potential confounding factors and to test the
statistical significance of between group differences. This evaluation work will be ongoing
beyond FY 2022. The FY 2022 Evaluation Plan and its successors provide further details.

1.2 VA MISSION Act of 2018 Section 507 Medical Scribes Pilot Program
Sections III & IV: Required and Existing Evidence & Evidence Gaps
VHA developed a 2-year medical scribes pilot in VA's emergency departments and
specialty care clinics to help improve provider productivity and increase Veterans' access
to care. 194 OVAC, in partnership with research offices is evaluating the implementation
and impact of the scribes program on clinic efficiency and patient and provider
satisfaction, as well as determining differences between VA and contract-hired scribes.
Section V: Plan for Progress and Risks
OVAC anticipates submitting annual reports to Congress on the pilot's progress and
impact. VA will collect data for the evaluations through various means including interviews
and administrative data. VA will complete this evaluation work in FY 2022 and additional
effort is not expected. Further details are in the VA FY 2022 Annual Evaluation Plan. This
evaluation was included in these documents as it was congressionally mandated under
the VA MISSION Act of 2018 and assessed a critical need linked to access to care and to
provider burnout.
1.3 Increasing Use of Telehealth
Sections III & IV: Existing and Required Evidence and the Evidence Gaps
Telehealth is a useful tool to for VHA to improve access to care for Veterans. It allows
resources to be distributed based on need, regardless of physical location.
To increase the use of telehealth, VHA's Office of Connected Care implemented the
"Anywhere to Anywhere" initiative. 195 The goal is to allow VHA providers to administer
care through telehealth services across state lines, increasing Veteran access to quality
health care. The VA's Evidence Synthesis Program is assessing the initiative's
effectiveness to deliver VA mental and primary health care for Veterans. The researchers
found that video treatments and in-person treatments yielded similar outcomes in patient
satisfaction, number of sessions completed, cost, effectiveness and other clinically
significant measures.
Section V: Plan for Progress & Risks
VA will study various forms of telehealth in the MISSION Act Section 401 evaluation as
mitigation strategies for underservedness. Other sections of the MISSION Act, such as
section 402, also focus on optimizing the use of telehealth within VHA. VA is considering
additional evaluation work and will likely identify new projects in upcoming Learning
Agenda and Annual Evaluation Plan cycles. For example, a new evaluation was included
in the FY 2023 Evaluation Plan that studies the use of telehealth to improve access to
care for marginalized populations (e.g., women Veterans, Veterans of color, rural
Veterans) and its impact on clinic functionality and Veteran health outcomes.
Obtaining access to complete Veteran data from non-VHA care settings is a challenge.

research and operations offices have collaborated to fill many data gaps, such as a
research consortium created by Health Services Research & Development to develop the
formal infrastructure needed to streamline and facilitate sufficient access to VHA and non-
VHA data. Efforts to improve data access are ongoing.
Section VI: Attestation of Available Resources
Current or anticipated resources are sufficient to carry out these evidence-building
evaluation activities.
VHA Learning Agenda Question 2: Pain Management and Opioids
Section I: Learning Agenda Question
What are the ways VHA can provide clinically appropriate pain management to Veterans
while simultaneously decreasing dependence on opioids?

VHA Learning Agenda Question 2 (Pain Management and Opioids) aligns to one
strategy in the VA FY 2022-28 Strategic Plan. Implementing Strategy 2.4.4 for Opioid Use
Disorder: "VA partners to identify Veterans and Service members vulnerable to opioid use
disorder and develops personalized interventions to prevent or address adverse
outcomes from opioid-related dependency and improve Veterans' health and quality of
life. This strategy was written specifically to complement VHA's efforts to address pain
management and opioid abuse disorder and improve outcomes for at-risk and vulnerable
Veterans.
Section II: Background and Context
The opioid epidemic has ravaged communities in the United States with increasing
severity over the last few decades. 196 Veterans face an increased likelihood of developing
opioid use disorder (OUD) due to unique military stressors such as deployment and
reintegration, as well as common medical conditions such as chronic pain or mental
health diagnoses. 197,198 In 2018, over 900,000 Veterans treated in VHA had an opioid
prescription; in 2019, over 71,000 Veterans treated in VHA were diagnosed with an

OUD.
199,200 This is inclusive of Veterans with both acute and chronic needs; addressing
both is key for effective, appropriate VHA care.
This problem is also significant in the context of vulnerable and marginalized Veteran
populations, notably justice-involved Veterans as they transition out of incarceration.
Justice-involved populations have considerable burdens of chronic physical and
behavioral health conditions including alcohol use disorder, mental illness and substance
use disorder (SUD).
201,202,203 Similarly, individuals who have recently been released from
correctional facilities are at increased risk of homelessness, with 30% experiencing some
homelessness post-release, compared to 6% among the general population of adult
men.9 Ensuring that these Veterans are able to access appropriate treatment services
and maintain continuity of care is critical in reducing recidivism and promoting long-term
stability and well-being post-release.
Efforts to obtain evidence in this area will be ongoing with no firm end date. Rather, each
year VHA will learn more about VHA's pain management and OUD treatment efforts and
the best approaches to improve both. What's more, a notable challenge to this work is
that VHA is unable to observe prescriptions and opioid-related adverse events that occur
outside of the VHA system. This area likely will be an area of future study.
VA will conduct three studies to build evidence for the pain management and opioids
Learning Agenda question.
[Note: Each study described below presents its own sections on existing/required
evidence and evidence gaps, while risks and their mitigation for this part of the Learning
Agenda are common to the three studies.]
2.2.1 Stratification Tool for Opioid Risk Mitigation (STORM)
Sections III & IV: Existing and Required Evidence & Evidence Gaps
In 2017, VA developed the Stratification Tool for Opioid Risk Mitigation (STORM) to help
clinical providers identify Veterans who might be particularly vulnerable to negative
opioid-related outcomes and provide personalized interventions. 204 Demographic,
diagnostic, pharmacy and health care utilization data are pulled from the VA Corporate
Data Warehouse (CDW). This evaluation will determine if the use of the STORM tool

consequences for failing to meet the minimum case review target would affect both the
behavior of VHA providers and the opioid-related adverse event rate.
Section V: Plan for Progress and Risks
The STORM randomized program evaluation is underway. It assesses the impact of this
novel dashboard on Veteran mortality and opioid-related injuries, using case reviews and
a stepped-wedge cluster randomized design. The evaluators are using VA administrative
and clinical data to further examine the effects of the tool on patient-level opioid-related
serious adverse outcomes. The evaluation is currently in the analysis and dissemination
phase. 205 The initial evaluation ended in FY 2020 with plans to extend work beyond FY

Objective 2.4: (Innovative care) VA will improve understanding of Veteran specific
illnesses and injuries to develop and adopt innovative new treatments that prevent future
illness and enhance Veteran outcomes.
Three strategies in the FY 2022-28 Strategic Plan align with Learning Agenda Question 3
(Suicide Prevention) and VHA efforts to address Veteran suicide. Implementing Strategy
2.1.1: "VA engages Veterans and Service members and delivers services and practices
that promote lifelong well-being and resilience to improve mental health, reduce Veteran
suicide and empower and equip them to achieve their life goals." This strategy describes
implementation of three specific strategies to connect with vulnerable Veterans at-risk for
suicide. Implementing Strategy 2.3.1 (Inclusion, diversity, equity, accessibility (I-DEA))
addresses persistent, systemic inequity and barriers to benefits, care, memorialization
and services for marginalized and underserved communities to strengthen the experience
and improve outcomes for all Veterans. VA conducts equity assessments, identifies data
and defines measures to recognize barriers to health outcomes, gaps in benefits, care,
memorialization and services and risks to underserved and marginalized Veterans to
implement this strategy. Implementing Strategy 2.4.2: "VA incorporates emerging and
innovative methods and technologies to better understand needs and improve the
delivery of benefits, care and services to Veterans, Service members, their families,
caregivers and survivors." This strategy describes formal and informal partnerships and
research efforts to develop innovative community-based interventions that identify high-
risk Veterans and connect with them in the communities where they live.
Section II: Background and Context
Suicide is a leading cause of death in the Veteran population. Veterans accounted for
13.5% of all deaths by suicide among U.S. adults in 2017.206 Suicide rates vary depending
on service branch, age, sex/gender and other factors. 207 Reducing rates of Veteran
suicide among vulnerable and marginalized Veteran populations is VA's top priority. The
President's Roadmap to Empower Veterans and End a National Tragedy of Suicide
(PREVENTS) takes an all-inclusive, public health approach to suicide prevention. This
roadmap prioritizes suicide reduction research, implementation strategies and
emphasizes the need for program evaluations to ensure better suicide prevention for
Veterans. The Commander John Scott Hannon Veterans Mental Health Care
Improvement Act also expands VA and VHA efforts to prevent Veteran suicide and
improve mental health outcomes. As of July 2021, other related legislation is also
pending. There are several suicide prevention programs and interventions being
evaluated for their effectiveness in the Veteran population.
Efforts to obtain evidence in this area will be ongoing with no firm end date. Rather, each
year VHA will learn more about Veteran risk for suicide, the most effective clinical
interventions to reduce risk and mortality and the best modalities to delivering VHA

suicide prevention health care. VA will conduct three studies to build evidence for the
suicide prevention Learning Agenda question.
[Note: Each study described below presents its own sections on existing/required
evidence and evidence gaps, while risks and their mitigation for this part of the Learning
Agenda are common to the focused studies.]
3.1 Caring Letters for Veterans Crisis Line Callers
Sections III and IV: Existing and Required Evidence & Evidence Gaps
Caring Contacts is a proven and effective method of suicide prevention in the civilian
population. 208 This tool, which sends caring, non-demanding digital or physical messages
to individuals at risk of suicidal behavior, was adapted for implementation in the Veteran
population in 2019 for emergency department visits and piloted at one VA facility with
positive feedback.
Caring Letters, the latest Caring Contacts initiative, is underway and expected to have the
largest reach of all Caring Contact implementations yet. All Veterans who call the
Veterans Crisis Line (VCL) are enrolled in this program. They receive nine non-
demanding letters over the course of a year (randomized by signatory-by provider or by
peer), with the aim of testing the effects of this intervention on reducing suicidal
behaviors, including suicide attempts among VCL callers. 209 This large, multi-year
evaluation (FY 2020-24 for most outcomes) assesses the effects of Caring Contacts on
clinical outcomes and VA clinical utilization rates and budget impacts on the healthcare
system using two versions of the letters which is currently an under-researched and -
evaluated area of study. Findings may be extremely beneficial to assisting this at-risk
population.
Section V: Plan for Progress and Risks
This study evaluates the effects of Caring Letters on care utilization; mental health
outcomes and suicidality of VCL callers; identify facilitators and barriers to program
implementation; and conduct a budget analysis of program costs. Evaluators will
complete baseline analyses using administrative data from the 2 years prior to the
program's launch (2018-2019). Additional data sources include the VCL database
(Medora). Differences in outcomes for pre-post signatory comparisons will be analyzed
with chi-square tests, a Wilcox rank-sum test and logistic regression, zero-inflated
Poisson, or negative binomial models. Analysis for this intervention utilizes the RE-AIM
framework. Current analyses look at letter recipient demographics, including race, gender
and age. Current study timeframe is FY 2020-24 (for most outcomes) but future analyses,
data dependent, will also investigate additional demographics.

Sections III & IV: Existing and Required Evidence & Evidence Gaps
In 2017, VA launched the Recovery Engagement and Coordination for Health-Veterans
Enhanced Treatment (REACH VET) and is now used by all VA medical centers. REACH
VET uses predictive modeling and medical records data to identify Veterans who are at
highest statistical risk for suicide in the next month and allows providers and the Veteran
to determine if enhanced care would be effective. 210 REACH VET coordinators and
providers access this information from an electronic dashboard to identify at-risk Veterans
at their facility.
By September 2021, 95% of Veterans will be targeted through REACH VET predictive
modeling algorithms within the VHA system across the four required metrics (Coordinator
Accepted; Provider Accepted; Care Evaluation; Outreach Attempted). The Office of
Mental Health and Suicide Prevention has an ongoing REACH VET effectiveness
evaluation, assessing program effects on outcomes including all-cause mortality, inpatient
psychiatric admissions, outpatient mental health visit days, emergency department visits,
missed appointments and suicide attempts.211
Section V: Plan for Progress and Risks
A separate multi-year evaluation of REACH VET will assess the implementation process
as well as the initiative's impact on patient outcome. The study objectives include
assessing the implementation process and the initiative's impact on patient outcomes,
using a stepped wedge design and both quantitative and qualitative data. Quantitative
data are collected from Veteran's health records and identify barriers and facilitators
associated with the program. Qualitative data sources consist of site visits and interviews
with implementation facilitators, Suicide Prevention Coordinators, clinical leadership and
health care providers. Analysis follows the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption,
Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. The study is currently underway,
with possible continuing evaluation efforts in later fiscal years. 212
A significant challenge in suicide prevention is being able to accurately measure how
effective different interventions are. Suicide is a relatively rare event; it can be difficult to
identify meaningful effects when focusing on suicide outcomes alone. It is important to
consider other outcomes, such as care utilization and clinical outcomes, as the evaluation
work described here does. Behavioral differences between various Veteran
subpopulations also complicate the ability to generalize effectiveness to the entire
Veteran population.

VHA Learning Agenda Question 4: Military Environmental Exposure
To what extent have military environmental exposures harmed Veterans during their
period of service harmed Veterans, especially with regard to latent or chronic adverse
health effects?
VHA Learning Agenda Question 5: Military Environmental Exposure
What are the best strategies to implement state of the art evaluation and care models to
provide effective care for Veterans exposed to burn pit smoke and other military-related
airborne hazards?
Alignment to VA FY 2022-28 Strategic Plan
Objective 2.4: (Innovative Care) VA will improve understanding of Veteran specific
illnesses and injuries to develop and adopt innovative new treatments that prevent future
illness and enhance Veteran outcomes.
One strategy in the FY 2022-28 Strategic Plan aligns with Learning Agenda questions 4
and 5 and VHA efforts to address military toxic exposure.

for Veterans."
Section II: Background and Context
Over three million U.S. Service members have deployed to Southwest Asia, Uzbekistan,
Djibouti and Afghanistan and surrounding areas since February 24, 1991; many have had
burn pit smoke and other environmental exposures that can lead to poor health
outcomes. There is a growing urgency to address the potential health effects of military
environmental exposures of deployed Veterans more proactively and comprehensively
among the post-9/11 cohort. Because of lessons learned from Veterans harmed from
Agent Orange and various illness associated with service in the Gulf War, VA can
respond with greater agility to these identified threats to the health and well-being of
Veterans.
Sections III & IV: Existing and Required Evidence and the Evidence Gaps
Note: Evaluations on these questions are under development for inclusion in forthcoming
VA Annual Evaluation Plans. Investigators are still developing suitable approaches.
Most VHA facilities currently have neither adequate local specialized expertise nor
structures or processes to address the military exposure-related concerns of deployed
Veterans. VHA's ORD is investigating the associations between military environmental
exposures and long-term health effects; the Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses Research
Advisory Committee has recommended to the VA Secretary a comprehensive clinical
research structure to enhance clinical care delivery and evaluation in this area. Congress
Page 161 of 235
VA
U.S. Department
of Veterans Affairs
also mandated the VA/DoD Airborne Hazards and Open Burn Pit Registry (AHOBPR).
AHOBPR exams for burn pit health concerns are a critical tool to assess health and
function among Veterans exposed to burn pit smoke and connect them to necessary
treatment. Over 250,000 individuals have completed the AHOBPR online questionnaire
since 2014 (as of July 2021), yet only 10% of those desiring a clinical evaluation for
military environmental exposure have received one. (For reference, the standardized
evaluation consists of proactive outreach to AHOBPR participants, exams, diagnostic
evaluations and ongoing Veteran-centered care.)
Section V: Plan for Progress and Risks
To address Learning Agenda questions, a complete set of AHOBPR data and the
Corporate Date Warehouse (CDW) data of greatest relevance to research, policy and
clinical operations will be necessary to produce standard reports, facilitate ad hoc reports,
support recruitment for clinical and research projects, create analytic datasets and
establish evaluation activities (e.g., a dashboard). Such data will be essential to
understand granular health concerns and assess best practices in optimizing health and
informing an evidence-based approach as part of a larger quality improvement evaluation.
Identifying a fully representative cohort of Veterans who served in Southwest Asia,
Djibouti and Afghanistan, Uzbekistan and surrounding areas since 1990 and their
exposure status will be essential to conduct successful program and policy evaluation.
The Airborne Hazards Burn Pits Center of Excellence (AHBPCE) at the War Related
Illness and Injury Study Center at VA-New Jersey Health Care System and the Center for
Innovations in Quality, Effectiveness and Safety (IQuESt) at the Michael E. DeBakey VA
Medical Center established the AHBOCE IQuESt Military Exposures Surveillance
(AIMES). Current collaborations support AHOBPR data and analytic needs and the
evaluation and implementation of AHOBPR exams. The AIMES collaboration team will
document best practices gleaned from ten diverse, high performing sites, create a tool kit
for implementing best practices, create and maintain a dashboard of key metrics related
to AHOBPR examination delivery and facilitate the implementation of the best practices at
up to 45 VA medical centers. This work will be done in collaboration with the Health
Outcome Military Exposures (HOME) service, along with other appropriate internal and
external research organizations, to ensure coordination and adherence to VA military
exposure policies and inform policy decisions to ensure optimal evaluation and care for
veterans with airborne hazards concerns.

FY 2022-28 Capacity Assessment
Page 163 of 235
VA
U.S. Department
of Veterans Affairs
Background and Approach
The Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking (EBP) Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-435, the
"Evidence Act") requires cabinet-level agencies including VA to create and use Learning
Agendas, Annual Evaluation Plans and Capacity Assessments. In guidance documents,
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) specified requirements for these
deliverables.
The Learning Agenda and this Capacity Assessment accompany VA's FY 2022-28
Strategic Plan.
Since the Evidence Act became law in early 2019, the chartered VA Foundations for
Evidence-Based Policymaking Working Group (FEBPWG) has superintended efforts to
meet the statutory requirements of the Evidence Act across VA. The FEBPWG has over
190 representatives from the three VA Administrations (Veterans Benefits Administration
(VBA), Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and the National Cemetery Administration
(NCA)) and Staff Offices supporting implementation of the Evidence Act and EBP
principles more generally. Organizations with expertise in evidence-building and
evaluation, such as VHA's Office of Research and Development (ORD) and its Quality
Enhancement Research Initiative (QUERI), provide critical support to the FEBPWG and
assist other work group member organizations to expand and mature capabilities across
the Department. In turn, the FEBPWG works to advocate on behalf of Veterans issues by
featuring ORD/QUERI's studies in public-facing documents like the Learning Agenda and
to assist in coordinating efforts across VA offices.
Formal sessions occur monthly with overran average of 50 attendees and members meet
informally in groups several times a week to advance EBP efforts across the enterprise.
In addition to the statutorily required deliverables, the FEBPWG has spearheaded the
development, implementation and successful use of formal, documented evidence-based
best practices (such as strength-of-evidence checklists for use by non-expert program
offices) for administrative and policy issues.
Current Evaluation/Evidence-Building and Use Activities
Overview of VA Efforts
VA includes one of the premier evidence-building entities in government: the research,
statistics and evaluation offices of VHA. Although current personnel systems do not
adequately account for them, VHA has thousands of practitioners of program evaluations,
scientific and statistical researchers and clinical experts in quantitative analysis. Many are
in program offices or in the field and others are in dedicated research, statistics and
evaluation organizations. Some are recognized as the world's experts in their fields and a
significant portion of VHA's findings establish new or improved protocols for the health
care of Veterans and all others.
Elsewhere across VA, many offices have very strong representation in the quantitative
sciences. For example, the National Center for Veterans Analysis and Statistics provides
modeling, forecasting and actuarial information to assist VA policymakers and others in
Page 164 of 235
VA
U.S. Department
of Veterans Affairs
making important decisions affecting millions of Veterans. In VHA, separate from its
clinical research, the VA Enrollee Healthcare Projection Model (see this link) has provided
forecasts for healthcare demand by Veterans that are valuable contributors to decisions
about resource allocation, facilities siting and hiring requirements, for VA, commercial and
other governmental decision-makers.
VBA's initial establishment of a permanent capability to conduct evidence-building and
program evaluations is cited. VA does not currently have a single, overarching Office of
Evaluation, but is considering many options to recognize, endorse and enhance
evidence-based policymaking. Currently, VA has a federated approach to evidence-
building and program evaluation that recognizes strengths in a number of areas and is
intended to leverage that knowledge and experience across the enterprise.
Other components of VA welcome the Evidence Act as an opportunity to develop
foundational knowledge and skills of evidence-building as a core capability, rather than as
ad hoc efforts.
VHA Evidence and Evaluation Capacity
As mentioned, VHA researchers, statisticians and evaluators have a well-earned
reputation as thought leaders in health care and have a distinguished history in
contributing both to Veteran well-being and that of all those seeking health services.
Innovations such as daily aspirin regimes and the development of advanced imaging via
CAT scans are famous examples and VHA is still the locus for many significant advances
in health care practices and services.
Components of VHA Capacity:
ORD Health Services Research and Development (HSR&D) Program in VHA as well as
the ORD Quality Enhancement Research Initiative (QUERI) are VA's principal sources of
high-quality, independent, peer-reviewed evaluations and also maintain databases of
these evaluations on their website at the HSR&D website. For example, ORD's HSR&D
program, a principal source of research evaluations focused on Veteran care, has over
520 active projects led by over 840 investigators in partnership with over 40 VA national
program offices. QUERI has over 50 centers led by over 200 investigators working with
over 70 national program office leaders.
In addition, HSRD and QUERI use the Government Wide NIH REPORTER system to
also document current research and evaluation projects including high-quality,
independent, peer-reviewed evaluations, which are searchable based on VA funding
agency identity at NIH REPORTER.
The ORD Office of Communications and the HSR&D/QUERI Center for Information
Dissemination and Education Resources (CIDER) are VA's national resource centers for
disseminating and monitoring use of knowledge generated from research and evaluation
activities in VA. CIDER provides regular updates to the VA Chief Medical Officers as well
as the VA National Program office leads through the VHA National Governance Board
and affiliated Councils (quality and Safety, Healthcare Operations) on major impacts
emanating from research and evaluation.
Page 165 of 235
VA
U.S. Department
of Veterans Affairs
GAO recently documented ORD and QUERI's impact on the extent to which research,
evaluation and analyses support the needs of the agency: VA Health Care: Efforts to
Prioritize and Translate Research into Clinical Practice. The QUERI 2021-2025 Strategic
Plan documents how QUERI and related ORD funding support the needs of various VA
agencies and programs, how the evaluation and research projects reflect VA and VHA's
priority goals and promote knowledge translation and enhancing the substantial real-world
impact of research to inform Veteran care and overall well-being.
The ORD HSR&D/QUERI CIDER program provides the above mentioned regular
communications to VA Chief Medical Officers as well as regular updates to the Chief
Research and Development Officer and Director. QUERI provides data to the VHA
Governance Board, Healthcare Operations Committee, Strategic Directions Committee
and the Quality Safety and Value Council to ensure research and evaluations inform
organizational learning, ongoing program management, performance management,
strategic management and other measures of accountability. QUERI is the VHA point of
contact for knowledge translation activities for VHA as outlined in the VHA long-range
goals. ORD's programs have several venues in which to elicit input and respond to the
balance between learning, management and accountability, notably through ORD
National Research Advisory Committee (NRAC), QUERI Internal and External Strategic
Group meetings and HSR&D and QUERI monthly calls with VHA and VA leadership
members and other VA stakeholders.
ORD-funded research and evaluation projects undergo rigorous peer review to ensure
independent, high-quality and rigorous research and evaluations. ORD including HSR&D
and QUERI-supported evaluations that use quantitative, qualitative or mixed-methods
evaluations methods. The methods as part of the evaluation submissions undergo
rigorous peer review where the qualitative and quantitative methods proposed for
research and evaluation are scrutinized by Federal Advisory Committee Act- approved
scientific peer review committees. Additional information on this Scientific Merit Review
Process is available at the HSR&D website.
More than 2000 evaluations and evaluative studies conducted by VA each year are done
within VHA, as previously documented herein. Given VHA's expertise in the full lifecycle
of evidence-based policymaking and practices, VA has leveraged their expertise to assist
other components of VA not directly associated with health care. For example, VHA
provided the initial protocol for all VA program offices to self-assess the strength of
evidence used in their justifications for legislative proposals (in FY OK2022) and the
FY2023/4 VA budget request and subject matter experts consulted with other offices to
assist them in strengthening their resource requests through citing evidence.
The quality of data and evidence-building activities in these studies is regarded as high
due to the fact that, as documented above, a series of expert peer reviews occurs to
ensure that studies are well-formed and conducted with objectivity, that data sets are
verified and relevant and that findings are also peer-reviewed. VHA's evidence-building
and other VA studies are typically put into practice as rapidly as possible to impact
Veterans, policies and program activities, so their utility and impact is very high. Even
VHA's basic research is targeted at pivotal issues in healthcare which shape future
practices, approaches and policies. VA, therefore, can state with confidence that VHA
Page 166 of 235
VA
U.S. Department
of Veterans Affairs
statistics, evaluation, research and analysis are designed and conducted to demonstrate
rigor in methods, interpretation and appropriate dissemination and that these activities are
free from undue influence.
VBA and Non-VHA Evidence and Evaluation Capacity
VBA conducts operationally focused reviews of operational activities and conducts
evaluations in compliance with statutory and congressional requirements. However, VBA
is only now focusing on developing capacity within its lines of business (LOBs) to
regularly conduct rigorous program evaluations to support evidence-based policymaking
within VA and VBA.
Regarding coverage of this Capacity Assessment of statistics, evaluation, research,
analysis and evidence-building and -use more generally, elsewhere across the vast VA
enterprise reside pockets of strength in technical, scientific, research, statistical and
evaluative sciences and many of them focus on topics of concern in evidence-based
policymaking. However, prior to passage of the Evidence Act, VA had not established
standards and policies for such practitioners working across the VA enterprise, nor
processes to regularly identify major policy questions to be resolved though evidence. As
a result, for example, VA does not possess a single data store comprising all the
evaluation efforts being undertaken and there is no process yet in place to capture such
knowledge and ensure its dissemination and use by other offices (particularly outside
VHA), except on an ad hoc basis. The quality of studies, therefore, varies and VA is
developing approaches to ensure that data is consistently of high-quality and is suitable to
intended purposes. In the current and upcoming resource allocation processes, however,
VA will address these concerns.
In VA's Learning Agenda, the Department demonstrates its firm commitment to advocacy
and action on behalf of underserved, vulnerable and marginalized Veterans in the
selection of appropriate topics for prioritized evidence-building efforts. VA has
championed the interests of such Veterans throughout its history and strongly welcomes
greater focus on matters of diversity, equity and inclusion. Studies have frequently
focused on cohorts that have been historically underrepresented in evidence-building
efforts, such as our homeless Veterans and VA is committed to conducting its evidence-
building in a manner that emphasizes diversity, equity and inclusion both by those
conducting such efforts and the data and findings obtained as the result of those studies.
An important initial success in building awareness of evidence-based policymaking and
implementing its principles, as discussed previously herein and in VA's Evaluation Policy,
has been the VA-wide adoption of the QUERI-originated "strength of evidence checklist."
In consultation with the FEBPWG, QUERI developed a protocol to raise awareness of
EBP and ensure that the disparate organizations under VA approached justifying both
legislative proposals and ultimately, budget submissions, with rigor using a standard
rubric. For the FY 2023 budget formulation process, the FEBPWG developed guidance
used by all VA components requiring the assessment of their budget initiatives with
respect to the strength of evidence in justifications.

Obtaining Insights about Evidence/Statistics/Evaluation/Research
Capacity Across VA
This is VA's first standalone Capacity Assessment document and summarizes the
Department's efforts to obtain evidence-based input and insights along with findings
across the Administrations and for the entire enterprise. This assessment represents the
views of practitioners of data analysis/science, research, statistics and program
evaluations across VA programs obtained through structured interviews and surveys. A
limitation on this assessment is that VA has only just begun to coalesce such practitioners
into a community of practice; they have been heavily concentrated in VHA, as shown
previously herein. The outreach efforts conducted under this assessment obtained views
from most offices across VA where such expertise is located and future updates to this
assessment will provide increasing coverage as VA continues to move toward developing
a distinct community of practice. However, the identification of gaps and strengths, as well
as approaches needed to fill those gaps, have been carefully considered with increasing
convergence as additional practitioners enter the community of practice.
VA's approach to the Evidence Act has been collaborative and inclusive to ensure that
the exceptionally diverse perspectives across the vast VA enterprise are received and
honored. The result has been and will continue to be, that VA's important federated
strengths in significant aspects of evidence-building, -use and evaluation are adopted and
adapted by components with different skill levels, needs and insights.
In March 2020 and again in March 2021, VA's Office of Enterprise Integration (OEI)
worked with VHA's National Center for Organizational Development (NCOD) to develop
and deploy a survey instrument modelled on those used in the GSA-led Customer
Satisfaction Surveys for major agencies. The OEI-NCOD survey was available to the
FEBPWG members, and they were asked to forward the survey link to those who might
consider themselves practitioners of evidence-building, -use and program evaluations.
Submitters were anonymous, but provided demographic information about their
organizational affiliation, length of VA service, grade level, etc., which was used to
confirm the overall representativeness of the responses. The FEBPWG, while considering
the surveys to be convenience samples, believes the results are useful initial indicators of
VA's practitioners' concerns as they have become aware of the requirements of the
Evidence Act and evidence-based policymaking more generally.
Over 400 respondents completed the surveys, a number likely to increase in future years
as more individuals enter the community of practice and as the boundaries for that
community are better defined. The raw data and results were distributed to the FEBPWG
members for analysis, review and discussion. The VA Administrations were asked to
consider the findings for their own organization as part of their component's Capacity
Assessment.
The goals for the surveys were to establish foundational data and to obtain an overall
sense from practitioners of the adequacy of VA's evidence activities from their own
perspectives within the program areas with which they were familiar. Respondents
reflected myriad roles and levels, from SES leaders to field researchers and from the
array of Administrations and Staff Offices, including human resources, financial
Page 168 of 235
VA
U.S. Department
of Veterans Affairs
management, data analytics, medical research, program administration, information
technology, healthcare, benefits and others. Addendum A of this document contains more
detailed findings from the surveys.
Both VHA and VBA conducted extensive subsequent analyses using structured
interviews, focus groups and targeted surveys to obtain Administration-specific findings
from their many program areas and to establish the initial framework for a wider
community of practice regarding evidence and evaluation. Typically, practitioners are
involved in several aspects of evidence-building analysis, dissemination and use and the
VA-wide survey instrument, in addition to asking practitioners of research, statistics,
quantitative analysis and other types of evidence increasingly reflects those perspectives.
For example, the 2021 survey instrument was also used to raise awareness of the five
types of program evaluation, based on OMB guidance and definitions and sought
baseline responses regarding participant involvement in these activities. In the future, VA
expects to be able to survey individuals based on the multiple roles they may have, such
as leader/evidence user, manager/evidence builder, manager/evidence user,
analyst/evidence builder, analyst/evidence user, or analyst/evidence disseminator.
This report is based on the results of the surveys and interviews, as well as
Administration-specific interpretations of survey findings and reviews of existing policies
and practices regarding evidence-building and -use for the myriad types of evidence the
FEBPWG reviewed (see list under Capacity Gaps: 2. Evidence Environment Complexity,
below). Submitters from VHA, VBA and other VA components were asked to:
1. Assess current capabilities to carry out evidence-building and -use, as well as
conduct program evaluations in support of agency activities;
2. Identify existing policies and practices concerning formal and ad hoc program
evaluation efforts and other evidence-building and -use activities;
3. Determine gaps based on policy, people, processes and technology considerations
against requirements in the Evidence Act and generally accepted professional
standards for supporting informed decision-making;
4. Propose possible mitigations and solutions to close gaps between current
practices and the desired state; and,
5. Identify issues at the enterprise or field level as well as considerations across all
components of VA.
VA practitioners celebrate initial efforts by OMB to define standards and practices for
program evaluation and believe that as agencies develop and share such evaluations it
will then be possible to mature a set of government-wide preferred practices, such as
specific data-gathering tools and templates, cross agency knowledge management (KM)
and development of maturity models to assess the adequacy of such assessments.
Addenda A through C present detail about the VA enterprise's and the Administrations'
data gathering about evidencelevaluation capacity as well as results of their recent
investigations. Addendum D provides a summary table of VHA evaluations.

based decisions.)
1. Incomplete expectations about using evidence/evaluation for decision-making
(Expectations of Evidence/Evaluation Use),

and findings with interested parties (KM);
4. Lack of clarity as to knowledge, skills and abilities required by individuals who may
have multiple roles in the generation and use of evidencelevaluations (Training);
5. Challenges in recruiting, hiring, promoting, awarding and performing succession
planning for practitioners of evidencelevaluation activities (Evaluation-Related Job
Series); and
6. Lack of clarity as to the likely resource demands in funding, infrastructure and
qualified personnel needed to adequately implement Evidence Act requirements
(Resources Uncertainty).
VA FY 2022-28 Strategic Plan Alignment Capability Gap Findings
Many aspects of VA's FY 2022-28 Strategic Plan will drive the use of evidence building
and evaluation activities to improve outcomes for Veterans, their families, caregivers,
survivors and Service members. One stewardship objective and three strategies are
written specifically to address gaps identified in the Capacity Assessment. Implementation
of Objective 4.4 and Strategies 4.4.7, 4.4.9 and 4.4.10 will ensure evidence drives
effective decision-making that results in improved customer outcomes, performance and
the most efficient and effective use of resources.
FY 2022-28 Stewardship Objective 4.4: VA will improve governance, management
practices and evidence-based decisions to ensure quality outcomes and experiences and
efficient use of resources.
Implementing Strategy 4.4.7: (Evidence/Evaluation Practitioners) VA will develop a
competent workforce with the knowledge, skills and abilities to perform evidence building
and evaluation activities to generate knowledge for effective decision-making that
efficiently improves outcomes for Veterans.
Implementing Strategy 4.4.7 ensures VA systematically and consistently identifies
practitioners of evidence-based activities, provides training to develop a competent
workforce and resolves resource uncertainty (employees) to address three gaps identified
if the Capacity Assessment:
#4. Training

VA
U.S. Department
of Veterans Affairs
#5. Evaluation-Related Job Series
#6. Resources Uncertainty
Implementing Strategy 4.4.9: (Evidence and Evaluation) VA standards, policies and
practices institutionalize expectations for the generation and use of evidence and
evaluation and fully integrate evidence and evaluation activities throughout the
Department.
Implementing Strategy 4.4.9 ensures VA establishes guidelines, policies, tools and rigor
for evidence building that addresses two gaps identified in the Capacity Assessment:
#1. Expectations of Evidence/Evaluation Use
#2. Evidence Environment Complexity
Implementing Strategy 4.4.10: (Knowledge Management) VA's KM system, policies,
standards and practices provide an enterprise-wide solution to leverage information,
insights and research findings for evidence building, evaluation and effective decision-
making.
Implementing Strategy 4.4.10 ensures VA inculcates KM and institutionalizes practices
and systems throughout the Department to address one gap identified in the Capacity
Assessment:
#3. KM System
Capability Gaps
1. Expectations of Evidence/Evaluation Use
Those who generate and use
VA FY 2022-28 Strategy
evidence/evaluations individually commit to
the importance of evidence, but there is a
4.4.9: (Evidence and
Evaluation)
lack of widespread expectations about
evidence.
The Evidence Act, therefore, is timely and valuable for institutionalizing expectations
about the generation and use of evidencelevaluation. While evaluations in several areas,
such as randomized controlled trials in VHA research, do contain formal evaluation plans
as part of their pre-approval requirements, that is often not the case in other forms of
evidence-building and in other areas of effort.
Exacerbating the issue of standardized policies and approaches is that existing agency
practices are still maturing across the Federal government. OMB has issued interpretive
guidance regarding aspects of the Evidence Act and specifically, program evaluations,
but there remains additional opportunity for agencies to share preferred practices as the
Evidence Act continues to shape approaches.

2. Evidence Environment Complexity
The major components of VA, the
VA FY 2022-28 Strategy
Administrations, follow distinct models
4.4.9: (Evidence and
regarding evidencelevaluation activities and
Evaluation)
those efforts have organically evolved to
meet the unique characteristics of each.
It is a cornerstone principle in VA's implementation of the Evidence Act that no single
evidence or evaluation regime is suitable for all of VA's components due to their different
operational models (this is emblematic of VA's federated approach to implementing the
Evidence Act).
In practice, VA has identified several types of evidence-building activities which provide
valuable findings to guide operations, strategy, policymaking, resource allocation and
business plans. They include, but are not limited to:
Cost/efficiency studies, including cost-benefit analyses;
Business cases;
Program evaluations and reviews;
Randomized, controlled trials;
Statistical models;
Surveys of Veterans, their families, providers, employees, practitioners and
suppliers;
Operational performance measures, including those in Annual Performance Plans,
Agency Priority Goals, & leadership reporting;
Process measures of effectiveness or efficiency;
Policy analyses;
Strategy studies;
Longitudinal studies;
Capacity and requirements assessments;
Outcomes analysis and impact evaluations;
Improper payment studies;
Administrative data;
Multigenerational studies;
Quasi-experimental studies;
Compliance investigations; and
Multiple method studies.
VA excludes from the definition of evidence the following types of discovery and fact-
finding, per the definitions and limits of the Evidence Act:
News coverage;
Employee performance measures;
Patients' test results or Veterans' case files;
Individual Veterans' benefits appeals;
Individual Veteran experiences; and
Non-generalizable process metrics.
Page 172 of 235
VA
U.S. Department
of Veterans Affairs
The OEI-NCOD surveys found differences in perception about VA evidence/evaluation
activities based on employees' job titles and levels, indicating further work can be done to
fully integrate evidencelevaluation awareness and activities into VA's missions at all
levels.
VA's extent of evidence, statistics, program evaluation and research capacity is vast even
though it is not centralized. Moreover, the current effort to investigate the entirety of VA's
myriad evidence/evaluation activities is the first time VA has undertaken such an effort
and, as such, VA is beginning the process of developing a complete picture of all such
activities. This review of capabilities presents an initial report of those efforts and the
variety of ways that evidence-building and -use, as well as evaluation, are conducted.
Discussions with VA leaders suggest that evaluation and evidence-building efforts for
existing national priorities and policies are robust. However, those leaders expressed
some concern that their ability to obtain equally robust evidence on prospective policies or
resource allocation decisions is only recently beginning to become available. Due to the
complexity and detail of the investigations conducted across VA organizations, those
investigators' findings sometimes have limited applicability to prospective, new efforts
being decided upon by their leadership cadre. An important example of VA's emerging
capacity building in near-term evidence/evaluation efforts is the rapid response team
approach instituted by VA's Quality Enhancement Research Initiative (QUERI), whose
efforts are discussed in the following VHA section.
In some other areas, including some programs within VBA, capacity is being aggressively
added to augment evidence-building capability while ensuring that the desired end state
of a "culture of evidence" is built on a robust foundation. That process will take time and is
a key priority for VBA and VA leaders.
In the non-clinical service areas of VA, including VBA, NCA and Staff Offices, evidence is
commonly used to conduct day-to-day operations and to engage in service recovery for
instances in which quality errors need to be rapidly addressed. For example, the Veterans
Experience Office (VEO) provides customer survey results to VA Administrations and
Staff Offices and that feedback mechanism guides process improvements for access and
the effective delivery of services.
In discussions with program managers, they express satisfaction that variances from
expected levels of performance in their operations can be discovered and acted upon with
agility. However, many expressed uncertainties whether levels of service, including
timeliness and quality, were established based on direct Veteran feedback, program
evaluations, surveys and other forms of evidence, or were derived from operational staff
and past management decisions. The basis for some operational policies and standards
that are used for important resource and management decisions was not always clear
and it may be desirable to revisit some of these foundational standards to determine
whether they have evolved as Veterans' expectations have changed.
VA lacks a methodology or approach to assist practitioners in selecting which
approach(es) is/are appropriate for various requirements for:
Accuracy/precision
Page 173 of 235
VA
U.S. Department
of Veterans Affairs
Relevance
Confidence
Repeatability
Significance
Generalizability/applicability
This gap is an opportunity for the VA enterprise to satisfy the desire for clear guidelines,
templates, or a decision-tree tool for selection of appropriate evidence approaches
depending on the issue, its timeliness, the required rigor of the evidence and the
availability of data. VA's initial development of an agency-wide evaluation policy is an
important first step in addressing this gap.
3. Knowledge Management (KM) System
Underlying observations about insufficient
VA FY 2022-28 Strategy
evidencelevaluation or access to potentially
4.4.10: (Knowledge
relevant findings is the fact that none of the
Management)
organizations reviewed possess a KM system or
tool, nor does the VA enterprise level, other than
highly specific tools for individual programs.
In fact, there is no existing mechanism to easily search current research efforts, such as
by keywords, to find specific topics of interest, thus such searches are performed
manually. For topics that span different research entities a manual, general data call is
required. The VA enterprise does maintain and update a data repository for public data
sets submitted by VA researchers at the Open Data Portal which is compliant with the
government's Open Data Policy (OMB M-13-13), but a policy requiring its use is only now
being developed. VA is developing an approach for such a KM system and is likely to
enter a requirements development effort. The FEBPWG is currently discovering existing
efforts across government and the private sector which may provide insights and options
for VA's use.
The lack of a comprehensive solution for KM is a key gap. When and if the volume of
evidence-building and evaluation activities increase, the lack of KM solutions will become
an endemic weakness in VA's capability to build and use evidence unless a suitable
approach is put in place.
4. Training
While foundational training is available on
VA FY 2022-28 Strategy
quantitative analysis and the OMB-GSA series
4.4.7: (Evidence/Evaluation
on evaluation also provides valuable learning,
Practitioners)
VA has not developed a means to assess
competence levels or gaps for the several
requirements needed.
For example, familiarization training on Evidence Act requirements and approaches has
been developed and deployed by VBA and they have also developed and deployed
training for evidence analysis. Many practitioners expressed a strong desire to benefit
Page 174 of 235
VA
U.S. Department
of Veterans Affairs
from all such training and these individual and aggregate requirements will be made
clearer as VA addresses the first two gaps identified above.
5. Evaluation-Related Job Series
Related to the training gaps and in concert
VA FY 2022-28 Strategy
with VA's participation with OPM in activities to
4.4.7: (Evidence/Evaluation
establish an evaluation-related job series,
Practitioners)
there is currently the need for a job series for
evaluation.
Fortunately, the Evidence Act directs OPM to address this need. The current lack of such
a series causes hiring organizations to generate inconsistent, ad hoc requirements for
knowledge, skills and abilities (KSAs) when filling positions. For example, VA
organizations provided more than a dozen position descriptions (PDs) to the OPM task
force, since there is no single set of fully appropriate PDs that meet most needs across
VA. Instead, often a host of related certifications and backgrounds are used to signal
competence for evaluation-related jobs. This effect prevents practitioners from marshaling
their talents for career advancement in related quantitative skills positions, from
determining sensible training needs, or from being adequately compensated and
recognized for the depth and breadth of their knowledge and achievements. VA
respondents expressed concern that having to fashion narrow job descriptions without an
overarching professional framework causes them to be at a disadvantage relative to other
public and non-public employers. Also, the lack of standard PDs, either within VA or
suggested by OPM, makes it difficult for VA leaders to know the extent of potential current
gaps in KSAs of our practitioners, difficult to know which gaps to fill or the degree and
consistency of KSAs necessary to reach and sustain our desired "culture of evidence."
6. Resources Uncertainty
Establishing an enduring job series and
VA FY 2022-28 Strategy
possibly realigning positions to it, may require
4.4.7: (Evidence/Evaluation
shifting FTE resources.
Practitioners)
Additional funding for training will also be required to effectively institute a newly defined
cadre of evaluators and evidence professionals, even if additional hires are not
considered. Valuable evaluations and evidence-building are already constrained in parts
of VA by funding and there is uncertainty as to whether a greater emphasis on formal
evaluation or other types of evidence-building will generate additional resource
requirements.
For example, despite its extensive network of over 50 centers including over 30 partnered
evaluation initiatives to support high-quality, independent, rigorous evaluations for VA
national program offices, QUERI cites funding as the biggest constraint on its evaluation
capacity. On average, QUERI funds 47% of implementation, evaluation and quality
improvement focused applications each cycle. In FY 2021 for example, QUERI needed to
delay launching new implementation and evaluation initiatives addressing key VA
priorities, including suicide prevention and medication surveillance, due to funding
constraints. (QUERI Partnered Evaluation Initiatives typically involve co-funding, which
Page 175 of 235
VA
U.S. Department
of Veterans Affairs
has allowed QUERI to support a range of VA Program Office and VISN evaluation needs
with a limited budget, but the co-funding requirement could be an obstacle for potential
partners with fewer resources and funding. During QUERI's 2021-2025 strategic planning
process, which involved gathering feedback from more than 150 stakeholders across VA,
the co-funding requirement was cited as a key challenge in working with QUERI.) As of
this writing, OEI has been granted by OMB two additional evaluator analyst positions
beginning in FY 2022 and VA is grateful for this consideration. However, this constitutes a
small down payment on what will be a major series of investments. VA is using the FY
2023 and subsequent resource allocation processes to propose addressing this gap, but
there are myriad, competing priorities across VA which are often viewed as more urgent
than near-term evidence based activities.
In several areas of the agency's efforts, there is a direct correlation between FTEs and
additional evidence-building, evaluation, statistics and research. In the past, VA programs
dedicated as many resources as possible to supporting Veterans and evaluation was
viewed as less important. That view is changing, but the fact remains that for most
activities there are not funds available for evaluation without reducing support and care
for Veterans. Even in accepting the argument that such evidence/evaluation efforts will
help better direct VA's efforts on behalf of Veterans, those benefits will not accrue in the
near term and redirection of program funds will have to occur in anticipation of a future
benefit to improved program performance. Temporary solutions such as detailees,
cooperative research efforts and external researchers are already widely used, but they
are not sufficient to address this gap.
That tradeoff and the realities of impacts on Veterans will slow VA's capacity to increase
evaluative activities without additional funding. Pending such increases, VA components
are currently examining approaches to enhance evidencelevaluation activities to bridge
the resource gap until economies based on those activities are realized.
Gap Fill Activities
1. Expectations of Evidence/Evaluation Use
Raising awareness of requirements for evidence-building -use and evaluation is the
cornerstone of VA's approach to enhancing EBP efforts. Practitioners are increasingly
familiar with Evidence Act requirements. Members of the FEBPWG will continue to
disseminate information to and implement procedures with the community of practice
while determining preferred practices for doing so. Those who are now actively engaged
in evidence/evaluation efforts are increasingly appreciating their roles and responsibilities
under the Evidence Act.
VA leadership is reinforcing the introduction and use of EBP by sponsoring independent
reviews of the "strength of evidence" in legislative proposals, budget requests and, in the
future, regulatory issuance. A "strength of evidence" checklist and formal scoring protocol
was piloted during 2020 in VHA for both legislative and budget proposals and a similar
approach was used by OEI to evaluate proposals across VA at the enterprise level while
VBA piloted use of the rubric for some of their budget justifications. In 2021, VBA
significantly broadened their use of strength of evidence assessments for their budget
Page 176 of 235
VA
U.S. Department
of Veterans Affairs
proposals, while VHA enhanced their use of evidence-based budgeting and evidence-
based prioritization of legislative proposals. For the FY 2023 enterprise legislative
proposal review and internal budget formulation processes, VA leadership is receiving the
scored results of such assessments to assist in decision-making.
Initial feedback from VHA and VBA strongly indicates that the strength of evidence
assessments were powerful aids to program offices in marshalling facts and evidence
they had not previously supposed were relevant outside their routine operations. While
some programs acknowledged that potentially useful evidence for their proposals was
lacking, many others had not previously realized that such information was welcome by
decision-makers. The very significant finding for VA leaders has been that the Evidence
Act and the principles of evidence-based policymaking, more generally, are frequently
welcome by program managers as validating and confirming what they had believed or
known but had not persuasively communicated in the past. The use of the strength-of-
evidence assessment is very likely to be an enduring part of administrative processes
across the enterprise and serves to validate its use for broader policy deliberations.
The use of this standardized tool and approach which provide transparency about the
requirements for evidence-based administrative processes is a cornerstone of VA's
implementation of evidence-based management and governance. Practitioners are
enthusiastic that requirements for strong evidence in decision-making are made clear,
issued well in advance of required submissions and that scoring of submissions provides
equitable accountability and a means of continuing to refine submissions. These new
approaches establish strong expectations for and awareness of, evidence-building, -use
and evaluation.
The VHA evaluation experts who originated the "strength of evidence" checklist have
published peer-reviewed articles on this approach to provide further transparency and
sharing of these thought-leading efforts. The strength of evidence checklist is based on
longstanding processes developed with the Evidence Synthesis Program (ESP).
Established in 2007, ESP makes high-quality evidence synthesis available to clinicians,
managers and policymakers as they work to improve the health and healthcare of
Veterans. ESP reports help develop clinical policies informed by evidence; implement
effective services to improve patient outcomes and to support VA clinical practice
guidelines and performance measures; and set the direction for future research to
address gaps in clinical knowledge.

VA is currently completing a policy on evaluation to acknowledge best practices in the
Department and to set baseline expectations for the building and use of evidence
pursuant to M-20-12 and M-21-27. One of the requirements to be addressed is the
principle that the quality and amount of evidence provided should be proportional to the
underlying proposal's potential impact on Veterans.
At the VA Administration level, VBA has issued a memorandum citing the importance of
using evidence in decision-making. VHA is considering governance options related to its
current evidencel/evaluation approaches that can increasingly normalize the generation
and use of evidence.
2. Evidence Environment Complexity
Overall, VA's goal is to normalize the building and use of evidence and evaluations while
continuing to optimize existing areas of strength. Developing and implementing new
policies and practices concerning evidence will accomplish that goal.
VA practitioners recognize that the nature of clinical, operational, research or other
business questions determine the appropriate types of evidence to be gathered. In
concert with OMB efforts, VA and its components will explore repeatable procedures to
ensure that appropriate types of evidence are collected to address questions.
Additionally, clarifying roles and responsibilities for identifying different types of evidence
building and ownership of the questions that require it, will assist VA organizations in
determining which evidence to obtain under specific circumstances and requirements.
VA's goal is to develop tools and processes to help practitioners across the agency
determine the types of evidence which best answer policy/program/process questions
and to identify the types of such questions that can be addressed with specific
evidencelevaluation efforts. To facilitate that learning, VA is exploring means to compile
evidence selection experiences that will assist subsequent investigators, such as with a
KM solution (see below). The expectation is that templates with selection criteria will be
developed to target the efforts of analysts depending on the nature of the question and
the purpose of the study.
3. Knowledge Management
Related to the issue of selection of evidence types and approaches is the need to
systematically capture study methodologies, data sets and findings so they can inform
subsequent efforts. While VA often can apply evidence to a particular question that
caused the evidence to be obtained, such as with focused organizational performance
indicators, it is less common that data sets and findings reliably inform related and follow-
on studies. Currently, such KM occurs narrowly due to individual efforts and localized
databases.
As part of the 2021 capability survey to VA practitioners, a special section was included
on KM, since free-text comments from the 2020 instrument indicated KM as the most-
cited area of concern. The questions asked respondents to identify which aspects of KM
Page 178 of 235
VA
U.S. Department
of Veterans Affairs
were of most concern and most needed, including discovery of findings, contextualization
of findings, organization of knowledge, search and the application of such knowledge for
use in further knowledge creation or its application to decisions and policymaking. Nearly
all respondents indicated that all aspects of KM were of concern and important.
KM will not develop solely due to introduction of a policy about it. Rather, spiral
development of KM tools and their use will cause policy to be initiated that will encourage
further development of tools and their use. Such spiral development will occur over time.
There are many visualization tools in use across VA that highlight data sets of many types
and present analyses and views for those who may not have initially contributed them.
Those tools which demonstrate repeated access may serve as the initial prototypes to
meet enterprise expectations, but it is likely that more robust platforms and solutions will
need to be implemented to support the variety of uses demanded by practitioners.
As part of the movement toward an enterprise KM solution, the current approach of
concentrating quantitative skills and associated data in specific offices should be
reconsidered. The Office of the Chief Data Officer will help guide this effort. Foundational
skills and data sets should be widely shared, with sharing among practitioners being
facilitated and recognized as a meaningful professional contribution.
4. Training
Skills training on a variety of types of analysis and their associated data sets is needed for
practitioners at all levels, with more basic instruction for those seeking to broaden and
deepen their analytical skills. Applied training for all practitioners on compliance with
requirements of the Evidence Act and EBP will also raise awareness of emerging
requirements and facilitate the clarification of roles and responsibilities for
evidencelevaluation.
With respect to "hard" skills development in quantitative analysis and modeling,
commercially available courses are either highly specialized at an advanced level, or they
are broad survey courses not targeted at addressing evidence-building, -use and
evaluation as envisioned by the Evidence Act. Over time such targeted training is likely to
emerge, but VA practitioners at all levels will need applied training either in concert with
other agencies or developed internally. VA practitioners are thought to number well over
1,000, so developing a set of training requirements and obtaining required training for
them will cost time, opportunity and money.
VA is undertaking an effort to identify the requirements sets for training for individuals
based on their roles and activities, but this will take some time and will need to be linked
with OPM's efforts as they determine competencies associated with the forthcoming
evaluator job series.
As stated, familiarization training on Evidence Act requirements and approaches has
been developed and deployed by VBA, and they have also developed and deployed
training for evidence analysis, but the effort is new, and its sufficiency and effectiveness
has yet to be determined. In VHA, the Center for Evaluation and Implementation
Research facilitates mentorship efforts, but only to a limited extent. Organizations like
Data Governance and Analytics (DGA) in OEI, as well as research and some program
offices within VHA, do have software tools, but the OEI-NCOD survey free text responses
Page 179 of 235
VA
U.S. Department
of Veterans Affairs
indicated that needs for advanced software still need to be fully inventoried and
addressed.
Many analysts indicated their primary tool for statistical analysis is Microsoft (MS) Excel
and expert practitioners' expressed frustration with the difficulty in obtaining licensed
access to advanced tools such as SPSS, QuantaSTAT or those from SAS Institute. Some
others reported using Tableau for its interfaces. Part of the expansion of skills will need to
be training on suitable statistical and analysis tools, as well as providing access to
licenses for them.
Based on the findings of the FEBPWG, desired training solutions should demonstrate the
following qualities:
Stratification-Separate tracks and tiers for basic, journeyman and expert levels
should be offered with suitable certification for each.
Role-based-Building evidence, analyzing it, disseminating it and using it to
manage or make policy choices should each have their own modules suitable to
the role of the individual.
Sponsorship/funding-Basic-level training should be funded centrally, or free
courses could be used while journeyman-leve training could be jointly funded.
Expert training should be sponsored by the program office or Administration.
Experience-based and applied-Use examples encountered within VA whenever
possible, particularly in a case study approach.
VA plans to undertake a more in-depth review of the adequacy of current training
solutions and associated quantitative tools to ensure that training and tools are distributed
where needed, or whether additional tools need to be obtained.
5. Evaluator Job Series
VA practitioners are eager to have OPM provide a new job series for evaluation and some
key VA practitioners with extensive backgrounds currently serve on OPM focus groups
and other working groups. A standard job series for evaluators will help distinguish them
from statisticians or policy analysts (two job series which already exist), simplifying
recruitment, retention, recognition, promotion and awards. Individual offices now issue
specialized requirements and position descriptions that tend to discourage movement
among opportunities and "lock in" talent to specific tracks. In addition, having several
established job series in evidence-based disciplines will facilitate effective balance among
them and effective placement and positioning relative to other analytical skillsets.
VA hiring officials expect to make extensive use of suitable, standardized position
descriptions and job series grades and have expressed a hope to be able to transition
current employees to them. At the same time, these officials recognize that Evidence Act
requirements across government will cause a "rush" on existing talent pools of already
scarce, qualified applicants while sufficient skills enhancement training (see previously
herein) may lag. Despite these concerns they express a preference for the
standardization which they expect will benefit VA activities both in the short run and
longer term.
Page 180 of 235
VA
U.S. Department
of Veterans Affairs
VA is considering possible operational models which involve a mix of centralized
expertise in evaluation and quantitative analysis along with deployed assets with topical
or programmatic expertise, since familiarity with a practice's disciplines and practices is
frequently a prerequisite for use of quantitative and evaluative skillsets.
A significant benefit of establishing an appropriate job series with grade distinctions
regarding skills is that those skills can be targeted for improvement through training and
broadening experiences. Current VA efforts pending the issuance of the job series involve
obtaining a clearer picture of how quantitative/evaluative/technical expertise is distributed
and what gaps in skills and tools need to be filled and with what urgency.
6. Resources Uncertainty
The first two gap fill activities mentioned previously herein do not require significant, new
resources. However, without the next three gap filling activities related to knowledge
management, training and the impacts of a new job series, such foundational work will be
hollow. While the path forward cannot be defined with full clarity for any large agency,
what is very clear is that having policies and procedures without the tools, training and
personnel to carry them out is futile. As VA continues to refine its required capabilities and
the gaps to them, the full scope of requirements will become clearer.
The articulation of those requirements will also consider the increase in overall demand
and supply of evidence-building, -use and evaluation, all of which will come with
additional costs.
Several of the gap fill approaches discussed below will require the use of new resources.
To fully investigate the Learning Agenda's topics and to build the capabilities and
capacities indicated above, is beyond the current scope of the VA services budget.
VA can, however, attest that its currently planned evaluations for the identified Learning
Agenda questions are adequately resourced based on existing plans and proposals.
Certain aspects of those evaluations, particularly in VBA, will be carried out with external
assistance, typically from contracted services, but VBA has provided for knowledge
transfer to occur for their practitioners to rapidly build skills for future, independent efforts.
In addition, OMB has provided VBA additional positions to focus on equity aspects of
evaluations.
To address the full implications of VA's Learning Agenda focused on vulnerable, at-risk,
underserved and marginalized Veterans and to fill the resource gaps identified below,
approaches are addressed through the FY 2023 and subsequent budget submissions.

Addenda to Appendix E: Capacity Assessment Detail
Addendum A: VA Department-wide
At present, VA does not have a single organization tasked with program evaluations and
similar reviews, notwithstanding OEl's enterprise statistical capabilities residing in the

Outside of VHA, evaluations and similar studies are typically undertaken on an as-needed
basis and as directed in legislation or laws, across a wide array of offices, only some of
which have fully trained analysts. VA's initial development of an agency-wide policy on
evaluation is the first step in (1) identifying standard and needed practices, (2) specifying
requirements for evaluation and non-evaluation evidence-building and (3) building such
capacity in all areas of evidence, including evaluation, statistics, research and quantitative
analysis. However, VHA is widely regarded as a thought leader in health care research,
statistics and evaluation and that Administration is providing significant expertise, advice
and effort to the greater VA enterprise to accomplish those goals. Through this
assessment process, in concert with FY 2023 and subsequent budget requests, VA will
build significant capacity outside of VHA and to enhance VHA's already robust capability.
To raise awareness of the Evidence Act and EBP and to obtain foundational information
about their experiences from evidence practitioners (including those identified by the
FEBPWG members as actively working in research, statistics, data management,
evaluation and analysis) throughout VA, OEI conducted convenience surveys in 2020 and
2021 to obtain their views. Results and characterization of the respondents' self-
identification are presented below.

VA does not possess a single list of those individuals or offices involved in every aspect
of evidence-building and use, but part of the gap-fill efforts is to develop such an
identifiable community of practice. For the 2020 and 2021 awareness and discovery
surveys the members of the FEBPWG, representing the array of programmatic offices,
Administrations and Staff Offices with equities in the Evidence Act implementation and
deliverables, identified respondents. Based on the array of organizations represented in
the responses and their grade levels, VA believes the current survey is a good start for
obtaining a clear picture of VA's status with respect to evidence, evaluation, research and
statistics.
The VA-wide OEI-NCOD surveys contained more than two dozen questions with
responses using a 5-point Likert scale (from "strongly agree" =5 to "strongly disagree" =1)
pertaining to questions spanning aspects of evidence-building and use of statistics,
research and evaluation. A special emphasis was placed on questions regarding the five
types of program evaluation identified by OMB in their then-new guidance to help raise
awareness of those required activities and to obtain insights as to the current state and
prospects for them across VA. Demographic data regarding organizational affiliation,
tenure, grade and primary evidence-related role of the 400+ respondents were collected
in the survey instruments and relevant interpretations are included below. A series of free-
text responses were available for each section of the survey. Additional information
defining evidence activities and evaluation contained in OMB guidance was available to
respondents. (Raw data was previously provided to the Evidence Team at OMB.)
The surveys asked respondents to address all aspects of evidence-building and use,
including their research, statistical and analytical work. In addition, for the 2021 survey,
respondents also were asked to what extent, if any, they participated in any aspect of the
five types of program evaluation identified by M-20-12 and those definitions and examples
were shared with respondents both to raise awareness and solicit responses.
The 2021 survey had responses from 21 SES and 46 GS-15 staff members, representing
a 40 percent increase for that leadership cohort. The FEBPWG were encouraged that in a
single year of effort there was such a substantial increase in those leaders who
completed the survey, hence, awareness of the importance of evidence-based
policymaking.

The FEBPWG members reviewing this result agree that while VA practitioners have some
awareness of the benefits of evaluation, more work needs to be done to go beyond mere
compliance toward acceptance of evaluation (and other forms of evidence, based on
other questions' responses) as routinely beneficial. Such efforts are reflected in the gap
fill efforts for "Expectations,' above.

The FEBPWG members reviewing this result agree that the low level of agreement by
VACO/Other respondents that their organization has developed a quality evaluation plan
is an area of concern. Reviewers note that some staff offices, such as the Office of
Management (OM) or OEI, typically review evaluation plans, processes and results and
may assist program offices in developing evaluation plans, but less frequently are the
primary office of responsibility for developing such plans. Reviewers are encouraged that
VHA agreement exceeded a 4.00 score - one of the few such examples on the 5-point
Likert scale across the survey. Efforts to increase agreement are reflected in the gap fill

The interpretation of "effective" was left open to respondents The interpretation of
"effective" was left open to respondents to obtain sentiment views rather than assessment
of formal effectiveness criteria (which do not yet exist). FEBPWG members reviewing this
result agreed the low score for VACO/Other organizations, especially in 2021, are of
concern. The result confirms the result seen in Table 1b and reflect, in part, the fact that
Staff Offices, such as Human Resources and Administration (HR&A), which have not
historically focused on evaluation as a form of evidence have greater relative
representation among survey participants. Nonetheless, the FEBPWG reviewers agree
that efforts to broaden awareness and acceptance of formal program evaluations are
well-founded. In contrast, VHA's strong 2021 response suggests that VA's thought-
leading organization for research, statistics and evaluation is deepening their staff

members' awareness of and participation in, evaluation efforts. Nonetheless, this survey
question targeted current perception, rather than asking for assessment of the application
of formally defined criteria, making the results noncomparable across cohorts but
interesting for revealing changes over time in sentiment based on awareness of EBP and
Evidence Act activities.

The FEBPWG members reviewing this result agree there is room for improvement in the
agreement of respondents that evidence is used in their organization's resource
decisions. The members agree that VA's introduction of the use of an evidence checklist
and outline for agency budget submissions will likely improve this result and it will be used
diagnostically to determine where and how else efforts need to be made to improve the
use of data in organizational resource decisions.

The FEBPWG members reviewing this result agreed that again, as in the previous
question (above), the result is bifurcated between VACO/Other and VBA/VHA
respondents, with VBA/VHA respondents reflecting the greater awareness and use of
program evaluation in that Administration. Reviewers agreed that the immaturity of
knowledge management solutions and the lack of tools to assist leaders and managers
identify appropriate evidence types suitable to the questions they have both contribute to
the low score for VACO/Other leadership use of program evaluation results. Planned gap-
fill activities should ameliorate this result, although measured improvements are likely to
occur over the six-year course of this assessment.

The FEBPWG members reviewing last year's survey indicated that many of the benefits
of VA organizations evidence generation accrued outside the originating entity. The 2021
survey, therefore, obtained baseline information to capture perceptions of such data
sharing. For VHA, knowledge is frequently generated at the field level and is
disseminated, such as with improvements to medical practices, elsewhere in VHA and
often to the health care community at large. For the VACO/Other offices, by contrast,
evidence tends to move up or down the chain of command, frequently exiting the
organization which generated it.

The statement was intended to reveal sentiment regarding program evaluations generally
rather than such efforts currently underway (or not) within the cohorts. The FEBPWG
members reviewing this result agree that respondents tended to concur that program
evaluations are effective in contributing to improved program outcomes. In 2020, the VHA
score may reflect areas of frustration with the transparency of how some program
evaluation findings were disseminated by the Administration. The FEBPWG members
and particularly VHA members, agreed that the 2021 relatively higher score on this
question are likely to persist as the working group continues to raise awareness of EBP
activities. In this area, again, investments in knowledge management tools, as well as
training, are likely to see these results continue to improve.

The FEBPWG members reviewing this result agreed the 2020 and 2021 versions of the
question accounted for some of the drops in score by VACO/Other and VBA respondents.
Reviewers also believed that in those organizations, as emerging requirements for
evidence/evaluation are made clear, there is an increasing realization that what has been
done in the past may not be sufficient to meet new expectations. In current and future
resource allocation activities, VA will consider how best to support evaluation and
evidence activities.

The FEBPWG members reviewing this result agree that practitioners of evidence and
evaluation related activities perceived they will be more engaged soon and that this
optimism is strong and consistent.
In the 2020 survey respondents commented in free text bout what elements they thought
limited their capacity to engage in evidencelevaluation activities and the plurality of
comments focused on the lack of knowledge management (KM) in some form or another.
In the 2021 survey, OEI-NCOD followed up to inquire on what aspects of KM were of
most concern to respondents. Their responses to those focused questions highlighted
that all aspects of KM, from discovery, contextualization, organization, search,
dissemination and use were areas of concern. While some respondents indicated their
organization lacked any KM tools, others indicated that their organization possessed such
tools, but they were lacking in some critical areas which limited their usefulness.
VA's evaluation policy is a first step in what is likely to be a long and complex path toward
such KM solutions. VA seeks additional support through resource allocation processes in
FY 2023 and across the duration of this Capacity Assessment to develop and deploy a
sensible KM approach to facilitate evidence-building -use and evaluation.
Across VA organizations, some of the strongest disagreement in both year's surveys was
that organizations provide regular training on evidence collection protocols. On average,
respondents were also concerned about their organization's dedicating enough resources
for evaluation.
Page 188 of 235
VA
U.S. Department
of Veterans Affairs
Free-text responses also revealed that practitioners seek more training on
evidencelevaluation methods. In informal discussions, respondents tended to aggregate
in two groups about training: Those whose primary role includes evidence-building and -
use sought refresher training and advanced training to expand their portfolio of knowledge
and skills, while those who conduct evidence-building and -use as an adjunct to their
duties sought more basic tools to facilitate their business analyses.
In all cases, respondents distinguished between applied and general skills, with a clear
desire to obtain greater ability to provide evidence to support decision-making by leaders
and managers. This encouraging result means that targeted investments in skills at the
analyst/researcher/practitioner level could enhance more rigorous use of
evidence/evaluation by decision-makers.
Another theme which was expressed repeatedly in both years' survey responses was the
perception that program evaluation requirements are frequently imposed in law,
congressional report language, or direct communications, but are almost always
unfunded efforts not already accounted for in established resource amounts. Concern
was expressed both about the independence of such reviews and their quality. As stated
earlier, VA lacks an overarching capacity to set and enforce standards for evaluation but
hopes that the current and future resource cycles will support establishment of a robust,
agency-spanning authority for oversight and tracking of rigorously conducted evidence-
building an evaluation.
A related concern expressed was that there tends to be lack of acceptance of "other
peoples" evaluations, especially in the absence of shared standards or the possibility of
duplication/overlap of efforts.
Respondents recognize that a generic analytic framework to determine the best fit of
evidence for issues is not realistic, but they seek adequate, applied training, as well as
templates/tools to assist them in working through such issues. Other practitioners
mentioned that the distinction between evidence types is often not clear. Not infrequently,
leaders are placed in the position of asking fact-based questions, but the respondent
does not have the precise information needed to answer the query. In such cases, other,
related evidence must be used to interpolate responses, leading to frustration by both the
inquisitor and respondent. Developing and using a more robust taxonomy of evidence-
types and associated tools to assist in the selection of appropriate evidence types and the
means to manage such knowledge are capacity gaps which are being addressed both by
policy development and resource requests.

factors associated with program evaluation
and other evidence-building types.
VBA's primary focus has been on the operational aspects of claims processing and
providing benefits as prescribed by legislation. However, VBA has identified opportunities
to better understand program effectiveness.
While VBA acknowledges its challenges in conducting rigorous program evaluation, it
also expresses that some of the proposed Learning Agenda topics, such as the
development of outcome metrics for the GI Bill, will lend themselves to increasing the
frequency and robustness of outcome-based and/or impact evaluations. In addition, some
Learning Agenda questions, such as the development of implementation actions leading
to establishing the Veterans Affairs Life Insurance Program, plan to conduct process
evaluations related to the effectiveness of their implementation in subsequent years.
VBA has made several additional strides to address this capacity gap. In part to help
more clearly define the purpose of evaluation and evidence-building, senior VBA
leadership issued a memorandum to confirm support and direction for evidence-building
activities. Training courses were developed in-house to provide awareness and more
specifically applied training on scanning the data environment to support program
assessment needs as well as developing and utilizing evidence in decision-making. The
courses (offered by the Office of Strategic Support and Initiatives (OSSI) and presented to
VBA in both live offerings as well as on-demand sessions via VA Talent Management
System (TMS)) are framed around a general overview ("Foundation") of "What is
evidence," and how it is distinguished from data, a course focused on developing the right
questions ("Evidence training for decision-makers) and a course focused on designing
studies ("Evidence training for analysts"). These courses are available to all VA
employees.
VBA also introduced a scoring rubric and set of criteria to furnish VBA Lines of Business
and Staff Offices (LOB/SO) with a self-assessment of their budgetary narratives. In
addition, VBA instituted an independent review of a subset of proposals and offers
LOB/SOs critical feedback on ways to improve the quality of their submissions.
Under the direction of the Chief of Staff's Office of Strategic Support and Initiatives (OSSI)
office, VBA developed an Integrated Planning Team (IPT) to assess the needs of the
Administration more definitively, including the areas of Evidence-Based Policymaking
(EBP) and Evidence-Based Budgeting (EBB).
The IPT's findings and recommendations, which as of July 2021 are undergoing internal
review, reinforced VBA's survey findings that VBA needs broader availability of statistical

software packages to support evidence-building VBA currently has staff that can utilize
these statistical software packages; however, there are limitations as current data is
operational focused. In addition, the IPT identified the usage of artificial intelligence to
support free text analysis as another capability gap. Lastly, as a knowledge management
platform where high-quality evidence and datasets could be shared was highlighted. VBA
plans to request resources to address these gaps as part of a general capacity-building
budget proposal, per Appendix D of OMB's FY 23 Budget Guidance Memorandum.
The IPT also identified the need to better understand how to best apply evidence and
evaluation in decision-making, as well as crafting a data Standard Operating Procedure
(SOP) to best harness data across the VA enterprise and link to external data sets that
could aid in assessing VBA programs.
The following table highlights the status of each gap identified in the original Capacity
Assessment and the status of efforts to close the gap:

Overview of FY 2021 EBA IPT
VBA established an EBA IPT to further refine its capacity needs and how it should
organize evidence-based activities across the Administration. VBA convened
representatives from both its Veteran-facing organizations and its mission support
organizations as part of the IPT. The IPT discussed centralized approach options, as well
as providing detailed feedback and recommendations in the areas of:
Operations/Process, People, Stakeholder Engagement and Tools. IPT members filled out
a detailed questionnaire and worked within four subgroups to analyze inputs and provide
detailed recommendations. Fundamentally, the IPT recognized the need for VBA to
create a dedicated organization that can provide subject-matter expertise in evidence-
building and evaluation, enact governance over evidence-based activities and coordinate
within VA and across the government.

VA

Overview of FY 2020 Survey
VBA conducted a preliminary 48-question fact-based survey over the course of ten days
in May 2020 to support the Capacity Assessment process across all of VA. Because of
time limitations, the survey was administered to specific individuals who possessed a
broader knowledge of evidence-building activities in their respective organizations. The
survey asked specific capability-based questions related to data gathering, the ability to
analyze data and the ability to produce results and use those results in decision-making.
The survey was disseminated to LOBs/SOs and used a snowball sampling approach for
further distribution to employees who work in program data development, or data use in
operations, strategy, resource allocation, or policy planning. This was a convenience
sample and does not have statistical significance since the full cohort was not known. As
such, it is not possible to accurately calculate a response rate for the survey. Sixty-seven
respondents from across VBA completed the survey. Surveys were focused on
understanding organization-wide evidence utilization with respect to the areas of - data
generation and processing, statistical analysis, program evaluation, research and
additional analysis. The gaps identified in the survey formed the basis of the gap closure
plan illustrated in Table 1 VBA Gap Closure Plan.
VBA utilized a survey structure that identified the key aspects of evidence gathering and
utilization, focusing on the availability and analysis of data in developing evidence, as well
as the utilization of evidence in various decision-making processes. As VBA continues to
close gaps, in the future it will administer additional surveys to address the impact of
those efforts and determine additional needed actions.
In VBA, respondents in the LOBs demonstrated a wide dispersion of views about their
own abilities to engage in evidence-based activities. On average, about two-thirds of
respondents believed that VBA leadership has documented processes for using and
evaluating evidence as part of its decision making. In terms of using that evidence to
make decisions, 63% of respondents said that leadership uses evidence in its decision-
making always or usually. However, there was a wide variation of responses across
offices.
VBA concluded in its own review of their Administration's evaluation and evidence
capacity: "At the aggregate level, respondents believed they saw and performed
evidence-building activities, but across VBA and within offices the responses suggest a
lack of solid confidence in their understanding of what these activities entailed."
Respondents expressed confusion as to the purpose and applicability of evaluation and
evidence and they also reflected the tension between accountability/compliance and
supporting improved decisions and learning.
Based on the VBA survey, there are evidence-based processes for strategic planning, but
there is lack of agreement whether there is a documented process for determining the key
research questions that would lead to selecting programs for evaluation; in addition, there
was significant divergence in responses of the extent to which the data and
recommendations related to an evaluation are independently verified.
On average, respondents to VA's survey agreed that they had sufficient evidence
collection systems. Within the VBA survey, most respondents identified Excel as their
Page 193 of 235
VA
U.S. Department
of Veterans Affairs
primary source for statistical analysis, with about 10% of respondents also identifying
Tableau as an additional tool. However, in terms of the types of data collected, fewer than
one-third of respondents indicated that they collected demographic or outcome-based
data, while substantial majorities reported that non-evaluative operational data was
actively collected.
Concerningly, no respondents who identified their organization as the acknowledged
experts within VBA for statistical analysis stated that they had access to any specialized
statistical analysis packages, such as those from SPSS, SAS, or Quanta.
VA's OEI-NCOD administered survey provided a number of noteworthy anecdotes
regarding human capacity in evidence building, One VBA respondent captured the
difficulty in obtaining necessary skills: "Our organization is able to recruit either individuals
with VBA specific knowledge or individuals with the technical skills needed for data
collection and reporting. However, we find it difficult to find candidates with both the
technical skills needed and specific program knowledge regarding VBA activities. VBA
would benefit from a program where new data analysts are trained in both VBA
production and operational activities."
Several respondents noted that since job descriptions are currently crafted for specific
organizational needs, training opportunities may be limited outside a narrow area. This
fact impairs employees in obtaining skills-broadening training and results in skilled
employees being "locked in" to their existing roles.
Within the responses to the VBA-administered survey, respondents were asked to assess
what level of expertise they considered their organization to have with various types of
evidence. They identified program evaluation as their strongest capability and statistical
analysis as their weakest capability. There was substantial variation within offices as to
their expertise; respondents believed their organization was either an expert or only
occasionally conducted these activities.
Less than half of respondents indicated that they could hire contractors or obtain
additional staff to complete the work of gathering and analyzing evidence. 100% of all
respondents to the VBA survey identified that they share their data with other offices in
the organization. This result is somewhat consistent with the VA-administered survey that
identified that 80% of the time, VBA shared information about evaluation findings with
stakeholders.
Each LOB who responded to the survey also identified that it used the four major
identified types of evidence listed in OMB's Memorandum 19-23 in decision-making
frequently enough that it emerged as a moderate strength.
As VBA develops its evidence base, the fact that it already has a culture established that
shares information will help bolster a more unified examination of impacts to Veterans
and can help the organization overall develop an evidence-based approach to decision-
making.

single organization directing or coordinating their activities. These activities span clinical
practice areas, patient types, national care delivery programs and analytically focused
organizations.
VHA Evidence/Evaluation Structure
For over 90 years, VHA's Office of Research and Development (ORD) has funded its
clinicians or doctoral-level employees to conduct rigorous research across the translation

of Veterans Affairs
spectrum, from basic biomedical research to rehabilitation, clinical and health services
research. This makes VA one of the only cabinet-level agencies with an in-house program
that generates evidence for clinical and policy use. This aspect led to an increased
demand for evaluation once VA programs and policies were deployed nationally. As a
result, national evaluation centers were established through congressional mandates that,
instead of conducting research, conduct assessments of existing programs or policies to
improve their real-world use in VA.
There are two types of evaluation in VHA: clinically and/or research-focused evaluation
that is used to generate evidence and operations-focused quality improvement evaluation
that focuses on new programs or policies in real-world settings. ORD is one of the primary
sources of evidence generation in VA and its research is funded through a separate
Congressional appropriation. This appropriation is meant to fund activities considered
research, which is generally defined by the U.S. Common Rule as the "systematic
investigation, including research development, testing and evaluation, designed to
develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge" (45 CFR 46).
ORD's Quality Enhancement Research Initiative (QUERI), whose mission is to accelerate
adoption of evidence into practice, is one of the principal VA programs funded through
VHA clinical administrative dollars that supports national program and policy evaluations
spanning VA that do not fall under the Common Rule definition of research. Given its
funding source and in contrast to the rest of the ORD-funded research program, QUERI
supports non-research, or quality improvement and evaluation activities (e.g., per 5
U.S.C. 311(3)) that seek to inform program or policy improvements. Nonetheless, ORD
and QUERI together identify common research and evaluation priorities, respectively,
based on multiple sources of stakeholder input, including VA national leadership, VHA's
Chief Research and Development Officer, Congress, VSOs and the scientific community.
On occasion, Congress will mandate a research or evaluation priority through legislation
or appropriation.
ORD's primary source of research-funded evidence generation is the Health Services
Research and Development (HSR&D) program that funds VA-employed investigators and
centers across the U.S. to conduct interventions aimed to improve the organization,
financing and delivery of health care to Veterans. HSR&D has supported national
randomized program research evaluations since 2016, focused on opioid management,
suicide prevention, telehealth, geriatric care and medication overuse, among other topics.
QUERI funds centers comprised of investigators and their clinical operations partners to
conduct operations-focused, quality improvement evaluation work at the regional and
national levels. Since 1998, QUERI has deployed and evaluated the uptake, acceptability,
adaptability and sustainment of evidence-based practices pertaining to different health
care conditions and issues affecting Veterans. QUERI addresses questions based on VA
national priorities that not only focus on whether the program works but how it works,
where it works and what it will take to sustain it.
VA leadership realized that evaluation skills, while complementary to research, did not
necessarily exist sufficiently in the current VA research world. To this end, QUERI
established two resource centers (Partnered Evidence-based Policy Resource Center
Page 196 of 235
VA
U.S. Department
of Veterans Affairs
[PEPReC] and the Center for Evaluation and implementation Resources [CEIR]) to
provide technical guidance and tools to support evaluation initiatives across the VA.
PEPReC bridges research and operations using data-driven evidence to evaluate and
guide implementation of VHA policies and programs. CEIR provides time-sensitive
consultation and support to VA operational leaders on evaluation and implementation
methods to enable the scale up and spread of policies and clinical practices aligned with
one or more of VA's top priorities.
Table 1 presents VHA's offices whose major responsibilities include evidence/ evaluation
activities, their focus, examples of activities and the documentation examined to make
these determinations. If no formal documentation was available or evaluations conducted,
it
was noted for future examination as appropriate. In addition, most of these studies are
ongoing, continuously leveraged by VHA leadership when making policy decisions.

Group
VHA Interview Responses
Responses to VHA's structured interviews were as varied as the activities in which those
many offices engage. A consistent theme was that those entities with broad portfolios of
programs under their purview, or which support a large portfolio of research or evaluation,
Page 201 of 235
VA
U.S. Department
of Veterans Affairs
such as ORD, QUERI, PEPReC, Product Effectiveness and Geriatrics and Extended
Care, are resource-constrained in their activities. For example, VHA funds less than half
of those implementation, evaluation and quality improvement applications that have been
independently assessed as "highly qualified," as well as delaying launch of new initiatives
of value that address key VHA priorities.
Several VHA responding organizations noted their activities were well-funded, such as
the Office of Community Care, Office of Veterans Access to Care and Women's Health
Services, but the Service indicated that its reliance on special-purpose funding made it
vulnerable. Other respondents indicated concerns about data access or IT support, but
these responses were specific to circumstances in those entities
A challenging aspect of the resources issue is that many research efforts, especially in
VHA, are not funded by the research appropriation, but by the main VHA medical care
appropriation. This is especially true for studies of clinical practices and programs, since
they are considered applied research directly impacting care. In these cases, VHA seeks
to justify the use of clinical dollars towards applied research versus those dollars being
directly used for clinical care. Nonetheless, some of these programs are funded through
VHA special purpose dollars, under medical services or medical administration
appropriation, which allow quality enhancement activities including evaluation or have
separate Congressional mandates to conduct research, such as the Office of Rural
Health or the Mental Illness Treatment Research and Clinical Centers.

Despite any underlying assumptions that program offices have the capacity and expertise
to conduct formal evaluations and provide associated documentation, it was revealed at
the time of the survey that not all offices do. Any gaps revealed may be addressed in
future iterations of the Capacity Assessment.

Addendum D: Overview of VA Evaluation Activities
VA-wide Evaluation Activities
Each year, VA receives numerous recommendations and requirements to conduct
evaluations from legislation, Congressional requests, Office of Inspector General (OIG)
and Government Accountability Office (GAO) reviews. These evaluations sometimes
arise in processes separate and distinct from our research and Learning Agendas;
however, they serve to build the body of evidence policymakers use to determine future
actions related to Veteran benefits and services. When such requests for studies arise,
they are directed to offices of responsibility with expertise in the subject's area. As an
element of VA's plans to address capability gaps, VA expects to develop an enterprise-
wide capability to track specific efforts in the context of the broader topics they address.
For the present, VHA has a mature approach to identify and prioritize such efforts.
VHA Evaluation Activities
VHA conducts over 2000 evaluations each year, focusing on answering questions that
impact the health and well-being of Veterans. Specifically, most of these evaluations are
conducted through VHA's Office of Research and Development (ORD), which funds
research evaluations across the translational research spectrum, from basic science to
clinical, rehabilitation and health services research, to inform advancements of knowledge
and generation of evidence to improve Veteran's health and well-being. ORD is
administratively managed in four research service areas and several supporting program
offices. VA research is an intramural program; VA investigators who apply for funding
from ORD are located at VA facilities across the country. This makes VA one of the only
cabinet-level agencies with an in-house program that generates evidence for clinical and
policy use. This aspect led to an increased demand for evaluation once VA programs and
policies were deployed nationally. As a result, ORD's Health Services Research and
Development program leads a significant portion of evidence- generating evaluations to
inform programs and policies. In addition, QUERI program has focused on broad national
evaluations of programs and policies identified by VA national leadership or by
Congressional mandate to improve their real-world use in VA.
There are two types of evaluation in VHA: clinically and/or research-focused evaluation
that is used to generate evidence and operations-focused quality improvement evaluation
that focuses on assessing the effectiveness and sustainment of new programs or policies
in real-world settings.

Appendix F: Strategic Planning and Risk
Risk Management is the process of making and carrying out decisions that will minimize
the adverse effects of risk on an organization or department. Enterprise Risk
Management (ERM) is a methodology that looks at risk management strategically from
the perspective of the entire department. It is a top-down strategy that aims to identify,
assess and prepare for potential losses, dangers, hazards and other potentials for harm
that may interfere with an organization's operations and objectives and/or lead to losses.
Specifically, in all Federal governments and VA is no exception, risk is unavoidable in
carrying out the Department's missions. Government departments and agencies exist to
deliver services that are in the public interest, especially in areas where the private sector
is either unable or unwilling to do so. This work is surrounded by uncertainty, which poses
threats to success and offers opportunities to increase value to the American people.
While agencies cannot respond to all risks, one of the most salient lessons from past
crises and negative reputational incidents is that public and private sector organizations
both benefit from establishing or reviewing and strengthening their risk management
practices.
ERM is a coordinated activity to direct and control challenges or threats to achieving an
organization's goals and objectives. ERM is an effective Department-wide approach to
addressing the full spectrum of the organization's significant risks by considering the
combined array of risks and opportunities as an interrelated portfolio, rather than
addressing risks only within silos. ERM provides an enterprise-wide, strategically aligned
portfolio view of organizational challenges and opportunities that provide improved insight
to prioritize and manage risks to mission delivery more effectively.
The VA ERM program focuses on enterprise-level operations using industry best
practices and in compliance with the OMB Circular No. A-123, Management's
Responsibility for Enterprise Risk Management and Internal Control (revised July 15,
2016).
It is understood that positive, or upside uncertainty, is often considered an opportunity
while negative, or downside uncertainty, is often considered a risk. The general use of the
more common term "risk" or "risks" represents both aspects of uncertainty. To treat these
risks and opportunities, VA's response may include accept, avoid, pursue, reduce or
share.
Accept: No action is taken to respond to the risk based on the insignificance of the
risk; or the risk is knowingly assumed to seize an opportunity.
Avoid: Action is taken to stop the operational process, or the part of the
operational process causing the risk.
Pursue: Action is taken to increase the level of risk taken to optimize performance
without exceeding acceptable risk tolerance.
Reduce: Action is taken to reduce the likelihood or impact of the risk.
Share: Action is taken to transfer or share risks across the organization or with
external parties, such as insuring against losses
Page 207 of 235
VA
U.S. Department
of Veterans Affairs
The VA ERM process follows the five-phase ERM lifecycles:
1. Identify Risks phase. Establish the context: understand and articulate the internal
and external environments of the organization; Identify the initial risks: using a
structured and systematic approach to recognizing where the potential for
opportunities or undesired outcomes originate. Continuous risk identification: must
be an iterative process, occur throughout the year to include surveillance of leading
indicators of future risk from internal and external sources.
2. Assess Risks phase. Analyze and evaluate risks: consider the causes, sources,
probability of the risk occurring as well as the potential positive or negative
outcomes.
3. Prioritize Risks. Prioritize: risks based on the results of the rigorous assessments
4. Respond to Risks. Develop alternatives and internal controls: systematically
identify and assess a range of risk response options and internal control measures
with consideration to the risk tolerances of VA. Respond to risk: make decisions
about the best options among several alternatives and then prepare and execute
the selected risk response action.
5. Monitor & Report Risks. Monitor and review: evaluate and monitor performance
to determine if the implemented risk response choices achieved the stated goals
and objectives and sharing the results with senior leadership. Determine risk
closure: establish a process for determining when the risk should be closed and
archived in the Enterprise Risk Register.
The VA ERM governance structure is organized into four tiers with designated
responsibilities. This structure consists of both new and existing groups focused
exclusively on risk in the Department's overall governance structure-creating new
channels for escalating, reviewing and acting on the risks that impact VA performance.
Tier 4 represents the top level of VA governance and is chaired by the Deputy Secretary
who has the authority to allocate resources to address risk response plans. Tier 4 is the
final arbiter of decisions and actions regarding enterprise risks and serves as a conduit for
coordination of mutually beneficial risks and opportunities with other Federal agencies.
Tier 3 is primary represented by VA Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary/Chief Risk
Officer (PDAS/CRO) and OEI Director of Foresight, Strategic Planning & Risk
Management, who ensures the impacts of strategy, performance and risk are considered
in all major decisions. The PDAS/CRO is the principal ERM advisor to the Secretary and
the VAOB and chairs the Enterprise Risk Council.
Tier 2 is primarily represented by the VA ERM Enterprise Risk Council (ERC). The ERC is
chaired by the CRO, or their designee and includes representatives from the VA
Administrations and Staff Offices. The ERC provides a forum to collaborate and integrate
the risk management and internal control efforts of the Administrations and Staff Offices.
The ERC also coordinates with other VA governance bodies to identify and share risk and
internal control information with VA leadership for decision making.
Tier 1 includes the risk functions within the Administrations and Staff Offices and the VA
ERM Working Group. Members are generally non-Executive Risk Owners, Risks
Managers, Risk Champions, Subject Matter Experts, Business Managers and Analysts.
