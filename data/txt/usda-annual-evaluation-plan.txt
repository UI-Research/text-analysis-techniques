U.S. Department of Agriculture - FY 2023 Evaluation Plan
Introduction
The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA or the Department) serves all Americans by
providing effective, innovative, science-based public policy leadership in agriculture, food and
nutrition, natural resource protection and management, rural development, and related issues with
acommitment to deliver equitable and climate-smart opportunities that inspire and help Americans
thrive. USDA achieves its mission via 18 individual Agencies organized under eight Mission Areas,
Departmental Administration, and multiple Staff Offices. USDA's vision is an equitable and climate-
smart food and agriculture economy that protects and improves the health, nutrition, and quality of
life of all Americans; yields healthy land, forests, and clean water; helps rural America thrive; and
feeds the world.
The Office of Budget and Program Analysis (OBPA or the Office) oversees and facilitates the
performance and strategic management activities of the Department, including development of the
USDA Strategic Plan, Agency Priority Goals, deliverables required under the Foundations for
Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018 (Evidence Act), and Enterprise Risk Management. The
Office is led by the USDA Chief Evaluation Officer. OBPA also chairs the USDA Performance,
Evaluation, and Evidence Committee and the Enterprise Risk Management Committee, both of
which are comprised of representation from Mission Areas and Departmental Administration, as
well as key partners, including the Chief Data Officer and the Statistical Official. These individuals
bring diverse perspectives and broad technical expertise to inform OBPA's initiatives and facilitate
buy-in among stakeholders across the Department. Partnership with the Chief Data Officer and
Statistical Official provides valued insights and advisement on data access, data quality, and
statistical methods.
Under the Evidence Act, USDA is required to produce an Evaluation Plan on an annual basis
describing the evaluation activities planned for the coming fiscal year (FY). The following Evaluation
Plan includes the significant evaluations planned for FY 2023, including the key questions to be
answered, required data collections, technical approach and methodologies, and use and
dissemination of evaluation findings.
Stakeholder Engagement
Throughout FY 2021 and 2022, OBPA conducted a number of stakeholder engagement activities
to inform the development of the FY 2023 Evaluation Plan. USDA's internal stakeholders are
organized into the following standard hierarchy to ensure that all levels are appropriately engaged
and to provide clarity around roles and responsibilities:
Strategic Direction: Responsible for setting the Department's strategic direction (Secretary,
Deputy Secretary, and Sub-Cabinet officials);
Departmental Operations: Responsible for supporting strategic implementation efforts in
alignment with the Department's strategic goals and objectives (staff offices such as
OBPA, Human Resources, Office of the Chief Information Officer, etc.); and
Mission Delivery and Performance: Responsible for aligning Agency strategic directions and
resources with the Department-wide strategic directions and for delivering statutorily
required missions, functions, programs, projects, etc. (all USDA Mission Areas and
Agencies).

Significant Evaluations
For the FY 2023 Evaluation Plan, USDA chose to focus on evaluations being conducted by Agencies
within the Food, Nutrition, and Customer Service and the Rural Development Mission Areas. These
Mission Areas were chosen due to their advanced maturity in evidence-building, particularly with
respect to program evaluation. USDA used the following criteria to identify significant evaluations
for inclusion in this plan:
Supports answering a USDA Learning Agenda priority question;
Required by statute or congressional mandate; and
Supports a USDA leadership priority.

outcomes?
Alignment with
This evaluation aligns to Goal 5: Expand Opportunities for Economic
USDA Strategic
Development and Improve Quality of Life in Rural and Tribal
Goal(s)
Communities in the USDA FY 2022-2026 Strategic Plan.
This evaluation covers the following programs: the Rural Broadband
Access Loan and Loan Guarantee Program, Community Connect
Grants, Distance Learning and Telemedicine Grants and Loans,
Background and
Broadband Initiatives Program, and ReConnect Program. These
Rationale
programs are designed to promote access to broadband in rural
areas. E-connectivity is fundamental to economic development,
innovation, technological advancement, workforce readiness, and
the improvement of quality of life in rural and Tribal communities.
Timeline
Expected completion in FY 2023
The in-depth evaluation of these programs will utilize rigorous quasi-
experimental methods. These methods include matching, matching
with regression, difference-in-difference analysis, synthetic
matching, instrumental variable analysis, and regression
discontinuity.
The in-depth evaluation will also use the input-output analysis
toolkit to estimate the short-run impacts of building out broadband
infrastructure in rural areas. In using this framework, the project
Technical Approach
analysts will use detailed data as inputs to simulation models to
and Methodologies
obtain estimates on employment and output for a specific regional
economy. The IMPLAN software and database will serve as the
modeling platform for this impact analysis.
These evaluation projects will be conducted by six trained
economists and social scientists at the Innovation Center who have
experience in both ex-ante and ex-post evaluation approaches. Some
of the projects will be conducted in collaboration with the USDA
Economic Research Service (ERS). The Innovation Center is working
collaboratively with program areas to obtain administrative data.
Administrative data available from the USDA Rural Utilities Service
(RUS) will be used in combination with other external data available

Database (ZTRAX) will also be used. The various datasets will be
combined using program service area information, such as service
area boundaries available from program shapefiles, census blocks,
census tracts, and Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS)
county and sub-county codes.
For the input-output analysis of the ReConnect Program, data from
published engineering cost and economic impact studies will be used
in addition to detailed program data. Project cost data housed in the
RUS represent a new type of data that are not normally stored in the
National Rural Development database but are essential for
developing model simulation scenarios.
At the macro level, the lack of shapefiles for program data to
delineate service areas forces the analysis to be at the county level

The RUS provides much-needed infrastructure or infrastructure
improvements to rural communities. These include water and waste
treatment, electric power, and telecommunications services. All of
these services help to expand economic opportunities and improve
the quality of life for rural residents.
The WEP provides loans, grants, and loan guarantees for drinking
water, sanitary sewer, solid waste, and storm drainage facilities in
rural communities of 10,000 people or fewer. Public bodies, non-
profit organizations, and recognized Tribes may qualify for
assistance. The WEP also makes grants to non-profit organizations

Through the RUS and WEP, rural communities obtain the technical
assistance and financing necessary to develop drinking water and
waste disposal systems. Safe drinking water and sanitary waste
disposal systems are vital not only to public health, but also to the
economic vitality of rural America. Rural Development is a leader in
helping rural America improve quality of life and increase economic
opportunities for rural people.
The primary objective of this evaluation project is to study the
impacts of the RUS Water and Sewer Loans and Grants Program on
changes in economic, demographic, and social outcomes in program

Goal(s)
Communities in the USDAFY 2022-2026 Strategic Plan.
Essential community infrastructure is key in ensuring that rural
areas enjoy the same basic quality of life and services enjoyed by
those in urban areas. The Community Facilities (CF) Programs offer
direct loans, loan guarantees, and grants to develop or improve
essential public services and facilities in communities across rural
America. These amenities help increase the competitiveness of rural
communities in attracting and retaining businesses that provide
employment and services for their residents.
Public bodies, non-profit organizations, and Federally recognized
Tribes can use the funds to construct, expand, or improve facilities
that provide health care, education, public safety, and public

services. Projects include fire and rescue stations, village and town
halls, health care clinics, hospitals, adult and childcare centers,
assisted living facilities, rehabilitation centers, public buildings,
schools, libraries, and many other community-based initiatives.
Financing may also cover the costs of land acquisition, professional
fees, and purchase of equipment. These facilities not only improve
quality of life, but also assist in the development and sustainability of
rural America.
The purpose of this evaluation is to focus on the two largest areas of
investment in the CF investment portfolio: health care and
education. The evaluation will focus on the impact of CF on health
and education outcomes in recipient facilities and communities.

Goal(s)
Communities in the USDA FY 2022-2026 Strategic Plan.
The Single Family Housing Program gives families and individuals the
opportunity to buy, build, repair, or own safe and affordable homes in
rural America. Low interest, fixed-rate homeownership loans are
provided to qualified persons directly by Rural Development.
Financing is also offered at fixed rates and terms through a loan from
a private financial institution and guaranteed by Rural Development
for qualified persons. Neither of these home loan programs require a
down payment.
Background and
The Section 502 Direct Loan Program assists low- and very-low-
Rationale
income applicants in obtaining decent, safe, and sanitary housing in
eligible rural areas by providing payment assistance to increase an
applicant's repayment ability. Payment assistance is a type of subsidy
that reduces the mortgage payment for a short time. The amount of
assistance is determined by the adjusted family income. Loan funds
may be used to help low-income individuals or households purchase
homes in rural areas. Funds can be used to build, repair, renovate, or
relocate a home, or to purchase and prepare sites, including providing
water and sewage facilities.

to All Americans in the USDA FY 2022 - 2026 Strategic Plan.
Goal(s)
Research has shown that the economic and demographic
circumstances of households are closely correlated with food
security status. However, not all households with similar
circumstances experience the same food security status. This
evaluation will identify measures of poverty and well-being
associated with household food security status among SNAP-eligible
Background and
participants and non-participants in persistent-poverty counties,
Rationale
defined as counties where 20% or more of their population lived in
poverty in the last four decennial Censuses. Moving beyond
household income, many dimensions of well-being and material
deprivation may affect food security status and SNAP participation,
such as mental health, depression, health-related quality of life,
disablement, medical expenditures, alcohol or opioid addiction, place
of residence, and within-household sharing of resources.
Timeline
Expected completion in FY 2026
Analysts will conduct county-level representative surveys of
household food security, well-being, and material hardship measures
in at least six persistent-poverty counties to help identify factors
other than income that impact food security status. The analysts will
also conduct in-depth interviews with a subsample of households in
these counties to provide additional context for the survey findings.
Counties will represent a variety of spatial types (urban, suburban,
