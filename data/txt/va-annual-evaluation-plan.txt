VA FY 2023 Annual Evaluation Plan
BACKGROUND AND APPROACH
The Foundations for Evidence-based Policymaking (EBP) Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-435,
"Evidence Act") requires cabinet-level agencies including the Department of Veterans
Affairs (VA) to create and use Learning Agendas, Annual Evaluation Plans and
Capacity Assessments. In guidance documents, the Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) specified requirements for these deliverables.
The VA Learning Agenda and the VA Capacity Assessment documents are appendices
to the VA Fiscal Year (FY) 2022-2028 Strategic Plan. This VA FY 2023 Annual
Evaluation Plan accompanies the VA Annual Performance Plan and Report, per statute
and is fully aligned with the Learning Agenda, as discussed below.
Since the Evidence Act became law in early 2019, the chartered VA Foundations for
Evidence-Based Policymaking Working Group (FEBPWG) has superintended efforts to
meet the statutory requirements of the Evidence Act across VA. The FEBPWG has over
200 representatives from the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), Veterans Health
Administration (VHA), National Cemetery Administration (NCA) and staff offices
supporting implementation of the Evidence Act. The FEBPWG and its membership
facilitate the completion and approval of the Evidence Act deliverables, including this
Annual Evaluation Plan.
CRITERIA FOR SIGNIFICANCE AND TOPIC SELECTION
The Evidence Act requires agencies to identify "significant" evaluations and address
them in its Annual Evaluation Plan, as well as provide a definition of "significant." Since
the passage of the Evidence Act, VA has viewed the opportunity of publicizing its most
significant evaluation and research priorities as fully consistent with its vital mission on
behalf of Veterans and their families and welcomes the chance to further advocate for
them by focusing attention on important issues.
VA engages in thousands of peer-reviewed evaluations and research studies each year
and none of them are considered insignificant. All are used to advance service delivery,
improve access, enhance quality and contribute to their respective fields of inquiry both
within VA and for Veterans and others. For example, as part of the internal solicitation
protocol for research and evaluation proposals across the Office of Research and
Development (ORD), VHA has a well-established set of criteria to verify significance:
Programmatic or policy importance or value of the evaluation and its value to
Veterans health care and health outcomes
Whether the evaluation addresses a new topic or topic that has not been
resolved
Whether it addresses a critical question related to barriers to optimal service
Whether if completed successfully, there is a pathway for the results to inform
improvements
Based on these criteria proposals are identified for implementation after peer review
and the results and findings are likewise peer-reviewed. To select those evaluations
most suited to the requirements of the Annual Evaluation Plan and the intent of the
Page 3 of 45
VA FY 2023 Annual Evaluation Plan
Evidence Act, OMB suggested criteria (Memorandum 19-23, footnotes 21 & 61) for
identification of significance of evaluations:
1. Importance of a program or funding stream to the agency mission
2. The size of the program in terms of funding or people served
3. The extent to which the study will fill an important knowledge gap regarding
the program, population(s) served, or the issue(s) that the program was
designed to address
To maximize the value of implementing the Evidence Act provisions on behalf of
Veterans, their families and caregivers the VA FEBPWG considered these criteria and
identified several VA-specific criteria consistent with guidance to further narrow down
our most significant issues and evaluations. These criteria were introduced for the initial
Annual Evaluation Plan covering FY 2022, and they continue to reflect the emphasis in
both the FY 2022-2028 Strategic Plan and the prior Annual Evaluation Plan on at-risk,
marginalized, underserved and vulnerable Veterans and their families.
VA Criterion #1: Existing Lines of Inquiry
(Consistent with guidance criterion #3)
VA's current efforts entail thousands of evaluations every year, conducted with a variety
of means and for many reasons, including statutory requirements. Evaluation
practitioners therefore seek to focus on existing lines of inquiry embodied in current
evaluation studies and efforts. Practitioners think that all areas of national importance
are currently being addressed at some point in the evaluation lifecycle.
Those identifying potential evaluations were required to attest that their pursuit of those
questions could be completed using existing funds under current services, whether by
reprioritization of existing budgets, or identification of evaluations that were already
anticipated. For those efforts, or aspects of efforts (such as, but not limited to, providing
additional subpopulation demographics to account for equity, diversity and inclusion
considerations), which are not already within the scope of current services, priority
resource proposals have been developed.
VA Criterion #2: Mission Focus on Veterans
(Consistent with guidance criterion #1)
VA acknowledges that there are several challenges it faces both with respect to our
direct mission-driven care and services, as well as our administrative functions.
However, VA chooses to focus initial efforts under the Evidence Act on purely Veteran-
facing topics. By doing so, efforts to address the requirements of the Evidence Act will
additionally stimulate internal VA interest and external stakeholder attention on the most
important issues facing Veterans and their families.
In addition, as organizations outside of VHA (which is highly mature in its capacity to
build and use evidence based on VA's Capacity Assessment) build their own evaluation
capacity, VA will broaden its focus to include administrative and other program offices
that are not primarily Veteran-facing.

VA FY 2023 Annual Evaluation Plan
VA Criterion #3: Care and Services for At-Risk, Marginalized, Underserved and
Vulnerable Veterans
(Consistent with all guidance criteria)
VA's FY 2022 - FY 2028 Strategic Plan encompass myriad areas in which VA impacts
Veterans - truly every aspect of the life journeys of Veterans - requiring a focus on a
meaningful subset of our Strategic Objectives. An immediate consensus emerged that
to rally attention and effort to VA's public evaluation activities under the Evidence Act
we would focus on the most compelling of our Objectives, namely enhancing care and
services for at-risk, marginalized, underserved and vulnerable Veterans, such as those
facing addiction, suicide, military environmental exposures and Coronavirus Disease -
2019 (COVID-19).
This focus aligns, as discussed below, the VA Learning Agenda with this Annual
Evaluation Plan.
VA Criterion #4: Alignment of Learning Agenda with Evaluation Plans
(Consistent with all guidance criteria)
Early in VA's deliberations, it became clear that the virtues of pursuing a rigorous set of
evaluations that would be showcased to many stakeholders due to the very public
nature of the Evidence Act requirements, such as wide public dissemination of findings,
meant that our longer-term Learning Agenda should be closely tied to Annual
Evaluation Plan studies. In this way, both documents would focus attention on issues of
wide public concern and be complementary. The goal is to provide preliminary
evaluation findings to policymakers early in the span of the Strategic Plan to address
initial, broader questions while providing further details with evaluations later in the
cycle.
Therefore, a critical criterion in VA for "significance" is an evaluation which directly
supports VA's Learning Agenda.
VA Criterion #5: Nomination Using Administrations' Existing Prioritization
(Consistent with all guidance criteria)
The FEBPWG decided that those individuals who were responsible for carrying out
such Agendas and Plans should use their existing, documented priorities (which align to
VA's Strategic Plan) to nominate a set of questions and research topics. Those
professionals are located organizationally within the major VA Administrations - the
Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and
the National Cemetery Administration (NCA). The FEBPWG worked with the
Administrations to focus their nominations based on the overarching VA criteria.
Each Administration has their own strategy and business documents that tie directly to
the VA-level Strategic Plan, and they are familiar with the most significant issues they
face that address the above criteria. In addition, VHA enters the Evidence Act process
already recognized as a thought leader in program evaluation and implementation
sciences, while VBA has a substantial process-analytic foundation but not one focused
heretofore on evaluation. (For VBA and other offices needing to develop their evaluation
Page 5 of 45
VA FY 2023 Annual Evaluation Plan
and evidence-building and -use capacity, VA's Capacity Assessment and related budget
initiatives address such gaps.)
This federated approach ensures that policymakers are able to obtain the most salient
findings addressing the most significant issues they are likely to face, while the
Administrations are able to pursue questions they are capable of addressing in this
Annual Evaluation Plan using the current and likely state of knowledge, expertise and
analytic capacity they encompass.
In the following sections, VHA and VBA identify the means they used to nominate
evaluation topics which were subjected to the above criteria for inclusion in this Annual
Evaluation Plan, and present specific plans to address Learning Agenda topics.
VHA EVALUATION PLANS
VHA will address care for at-risk, marginalized, underserved and vulnerable Veterans
with focused evaluations on enhancing access to care, suicide prevention, opioids and
substance use disorder and the impact of COVID-19.
A. Access
A.1. MISSION 401 Underserved Facilities and Populations
Learning Agenda Question: How can VA ensure that Veterans have access to timely
care in their preferred setting?
Evaluation Question: How effective are the underserved scores and subsequent
mitigation strategies in addressing facility-level underservedness?
Timeline: Activities will continue in FY 2023. Efforts to obtain decisive evidence in this
area will be ongoing with no likely firm end date. Rather, each year VHA will learn more
about VHA's supply of health care, Veteran demand for health care and the best
approaches with which to address both.
Background: Most Veterans who are enrolled in VHA care live in areas with limited
access to health care services. Approximately 16% of Veterans live within primary care
shortage areas and 70.2% live in mental health care shortage areas. i To improve
Veteran access to quality care, VA implemented the Maintaining Internal Systems and
Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks Act of 2018 (MISSION). ii,iii In compliance
with Section 401 of the MISSION Act, the Office for Veterans Access to Care (OVAC),
in collaboration with other research and operations offices, developed scoring
algorithms to identify underserved VA medical facilities in both primary care and mental
health care. Each year, the most underserved facilities are required to develop action
plans explaining how they intend to improve Veteran access to care at their facilities.
Study objective: The objective of this evaluation is to study the effectiveness of the
underserved scores and mitigation strategies at measuring and addressing facility-level
underservedness, to continually improve the statistical models used and to expand
these models to identify underservedness relative to specialty care. The evaluation will
also take into consideration priority populations (i.e., underserved, marginalized
populations) as outlined in the recent Executive Order 13985 (Advancing Racial Equity
Page 6 of 45
VA FY 2023 Annual Evaluation Plan
and Support of Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government), issued
January 27, 2021.
Study design and data sources: Models are developed using the economic principles of
supply and demand. Both a quantitative longitudinal cohort study and a qualitative study
design will be employed to evaluate their effectiveness. Data to be analyzed include
administrative data on health care use (from VHA's Corporate Data Warehouse),
Veteran demographics and facility and market characteristics, as well as interviews with
key stakeholders.
Analysis:
Assessment of Scoring Methodologies
The evaluation will assess how well the scoring methodologies for primary care
measure underservedness. It will also assess individual variables to ensure they are
important components in the measure of underservedness and worth keeping in the
algorithm (e.g., wait times, capacity, Veteran demographics). Should the evaluation
show that individual variables do not add any information of value to the model,
refinements will be made ahead of future underserved score calculations to either
replace or improve those variables.
Assessment of Mitigation Strategies
In 2019, OVAC submitted the first annual report to Congress that included the action
plans from the top seven underserved facilities. The facilities centered their mitigation
strategies in three areas: personnel-focused (recruit and retain high-need providers),
virtual care-focused (increase virtual care capacity) and infrastructure-focused (increase
physical space, as needed). OVAC and its partners will track a variety of metrics
constructed using administrative data and site visits and interviews to evaluate the
effectiveness of these mitigation strategies at addressing facility-level underservedness.
Evaluators will interview local leadership to determine what mitigation strategies (e.g.,
personnel strategies, telehealth modalities, physical space) were employed to improve
access to care. This information will then be used to assess how well those strategies
worked by evaluating changes in access measures and underserved scores.
Regression models will be used to control for potential confounding factors and to test
the statistical significance of between group differences. To reflect what mitigation
strategies were, in fact, implemented, evaluators will include a set of indicator variables
in the underserved models in place of the proposed action plan data. The analysis will
also include a comparison of underservedness between the facilities required to submit
action plans (top 20 most underserved) and those that were not. Evaluators will
estimate the effectiveness of the program by measuring the extent to which the action
planning group demonstrates greater improvement than the comparison group on
various metrics (e.g., underserved score, hiring, utilization of technology-based care).
Implementation into Specialty Care
Lastly, statistical models like the one used for primary care will be developed for
specialty care. These different areas of care require unique approaches given the
differences in the types of care provided and how that care is delivered. New models
will be developed with the input of OVAC and the Office of Specialty Care.

Anticipated challenges: Evaluators anticipate that the newness of the underserved
program may make evaluation difficult. With only three years of data, changes in
underservedness may be hard to quantify. Thus, quantifying the program's overall
impact may also prove difficult. Additionally, every care specialty has unique access
challenges. Developing new models will require multiple iterations and meeting
congressional deadlines for annual underserved designations may be difficult while still
maintaining statistical integrity. To address this, evaluators will continually update the
models to include the most recent and granular data possible as well as improve model
form whenever issues or concerns arise, be they from the evaluation team or external
stakeholders. Lastly, COVID-19 significantly impacted FY 2020 and FY 2021 data.
Determining how to best account for these disruptions to care delivery will be
challenging and may take several years to finalize.
Dissemination: OVAC began to receive annual evaluation reports from its research
partners in FY 2021Q2. The findings will also be shared with Congress in the program's
annual congressionally mandated reports. Evaluators will share findings with local and
national leadership as requested. Evaluators will also produce deidentified and/or
aggregated results that can be shared with the public. This cycle of dissemination will
continue so long as model development and evaluation continue.
Anticipated milestones:

A.2 Evaluating the Effectiveness of Virtual Care at VHA
Learning Agenda Question: How can VA ensure that Veterans have access to timely
care in their preferred setting?
Page 9 of 45
VA FY 2023 Annual Evaluation Plan
Evaluation Questions:
1. What has been the adoption rate of virtual care among VHA providers and how
has it varied geographically?
2. Does virtual care utilization improve clinic functionality and efficiency and
increase access to care?
3.
Does virtual care utilization affect patient outcomes and how do outcomes differ
across underserved and marginalized Veteran groups?
4. Does virtual care affect provider retention and turnover?
5. Are there unintended consequences of virtual care utilization?
Timeline: The project started in FY 2021 and will run through FY 2024.
Background: Most Veterans who are enrolled in VHA care live in areas with limited
access to health care services. Approximately 16% of Veterans live within primary care
shortage areas and 70.2% live in mental health care shortage areas. iv VA was a pioneer
and adopted virtual care services in 2003 to reduce the access barriers Veterans face.
By 2018, VA had provided over a million virtual care services. As part of the MISSION
Act of 2018, VA established the "Anywhere to Anywhere" virtual care initiative to ensure
that all VA providers in outpatient mental health and primary care service lines were
capable and experienced with providing telehealth services into the Veteran's home by
2021.
The COVID-19 pandemic brought an unprecedented public health emergency, requiring
VA to lean heavily on virtual care rather than face-to-face care so it could continue
serving Veterans safely. Going forward, it is important to understand how virtual care
has been adopted and scaled-up by VHA and how and whether virtual care should be
continued and promoted post-pandemic when in-person care is safer.
Study objective: The objective is to evaluate the use and effectiveness of virtual care on
four broad categories: patient outcomes, clinic efficiency, access to care and retention
and turnover among provider workforce.
Study design and data sources: Evaluators will assess the geographic variation in the
growth of various types of virtual care (e.g., telemedicine, Veteran Virtual Connect and
clinical resource hubs). Evaluators will develop economic models that evaluate the
effect of virtual care on patient outcomes, clinic efficiency, access to care and retention
and turnover among provider workforce.
The model parameters will be estimated using data from multiple sources. VHA health
administrative data (from VHA's Corporate Data Warehouse) will provide information on
clinic efficiency, access to care and certain patient outcomes such as continuity of care
and readmission rates. Veteran satisfaction measures from the Survey of Healthcare
Experience of Patients (SHEP) will provide information on patient satisfaction with
virtual care. For the provider turnover and retention analysis, the study will use provider
characteristics and preferences from the All Employee Survey. The study will control for
Veteran characteristics in its models; these Veteran characteristics will come from the
Survey of Enrollees. In addition, the study will control for a number of local area
characteristics, which will be derived from various data sources, such as the Area
Health Resources Files, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Census Bureau and the Centers for
Page 10 of 45
VA FY 2023 Annual Evaluation Plan
Medicare and Medicaid Services. Stakeholder interviews and feedback from academic
subject matter experts will inform model improvement, in particular how aspects of care
delivery, patient outcomes, clinic efficiency, access to care and provider turnover and
retention are measured.
Analysis: Evaluators will document the geographic variation in the growth of various
types of virtual care (e.g., telemedicine, Veteran Virtual Connect and clinical resource
hubs) over time. Evaluators will estimate the impact of virtual care on patient outcomes,
such as patient satisfaction, continuity of care and frequency of adverse events;
whether virtual care has the potential to improve access to care, especially in certain
areas; and the impact of virtual care on retention of the provider workforce and on clinic
efficiency (accounting for the potential learning curve) in terms of producing more visits
per day.
Evaluators will also investigate whether there are certain administrative processes that
make virtual care more efficient, such as scheduling protocols that intermix in-person
and virtual care appointments or consolidate virtual care to certain days of the week.
Evaluators will identify geographical areas or Veteran subpopulations that may benefit
from virtual care more than others and identify specialties that may benefit from virtual
care more than others.
Economic models will be developed in primary care first, due to more detailed data and
procedure coding. A model will be developed for each outcome measure within the
broad categories of patient outcomes, clinic efficiency, access to care and retention of
the provider workforce. Each model will be designed to focus on identifying the effect of
virtual care usage on the respective outcome measure. Economic models will be
grounded in a conceptual framework based on economic theory of supply and demand.
The models will include supply factors, including the use of virtual care and demand
factors, such as measures of alternative health coverage for Veterans, socioeconomic
measures, racial composition and other demographics of Veterans. These models will
be estimated via multivariate regression. Evaluators will translate these concepts into an
empirical model and use regression estimation to test hypotheses, such as whether
virtual care had an impact on clinic efficiency, for example. Potential confounders are
that the demand for VHA services changed (due to COVID-19) while supply or use of
virtual care changed dramatically. Evaluators will investigate whether potential natural
experiments exist that create variation in the use of virtual care that is not related to
demand shifts.
Throughout the development process, evaluators will seek feedback from local
leadership and other researchers to improve the model by assisting how to measure
certain supply variables. Local leadership will also provide a better understanding of the
application to policy. After the model on primary care is developed and tested for
robustness, model development will expand to include specialty care. Since each
division of care may be different in terms of its use, implementation and recording of
virtual care, the data and models developed may be different for each one.
Anticipated challenges: Prior to 2020, the use of virtual care was not widespread. In
2020, health care clinics were required to rapidly adopt and implement this type of care.
Due to the timeline for implementing virtual care, the data may not be clean or readily
Page 11 of 45
VA FY 2023 Annual Evaluation Plan
available for all clinics. Thus, documenting the variation in virtual care and quantifying
its impacts may be limited to areas that do provide clean data. Moreover, the external
validity of the findings may need to rely on stronger assumptions.
Dissemination: The VHA Chief Strategy Office (CSO) will receive annual evaluation
reports from the Partnered Evidence-based Policy Resource Center (PEPReC).
Evaluators will share findings with local and national leadership as requested.
Evaluators will also produce deidentified and/or aggregated results that can be shared
with the public through conference presentations, academic publications and media
outlets.

B. Suicide Prevention and Mental Health
B.1 Caring Letters for Veterans Crisis Line Callers
Learning Agenda Question: What strategies work best to prevent suicide among
Veterans?
Evaluation Question: Are Caring Letters an effective and sustainable intervention to
reduce suicide behaviors among Veterans?
Timeline: Ongoing; the project began in FY 2020 and will continue through FY 2023.
Background: Suicide is a leading cause of death in the Veteran population. Veterans
accounted for 13.5% of all deaths by suicide among U.S. adults in 2017. vi Suicide rates
vary depending on service branch, age, sex/gender and other factors.vii Reducing rates
of Veteran suicide is VA's top clinical priority. The President's Roadmap to Empower
Veterans and End a National Tragedy of Suicide (PREVENTS) takes an all-inclusive,
public health approach to suicide prevention. This roadmap prioritizes suicide reduction
research, implementation strategies and emphasizes the need for program evaluations
to ensure better suicide prevention for Veterans. The Commander John Scott Hannon
Veterans Mental Health Care Improvement Act also expands VA and VHA efforts to
prevent Veteran suicide and improve mental health outcomes. To this end, there are
several ongoing suicide prevention programs and interventions being evaluated for their
effectiveness in the Veteran population.
Page 13 of 45
VA FY 2023 Annual Evaluation Plan
Previous studies, including a 1976 randomized control trial of Caring Contacts in the
civilian population and later, studies in multiple different countries and populations, have
shown that Caring Contacts is an effective method of suicide prevention, in which
caring, non-demanding messages of support are sent to high-risk individuals.
viii
Contacts can be digital (text messages) or physical (postcards or letters).
Caring Contacts was adapted for implementation in the Veteran population in 2019 for
emergency department visits and piloted at one VA facility with positive feedback. The
Veterans Crisis Line (VCL) Caring Letters initiative is expected to have the largest reach
of all Caring Contact implementations yet and targets all Veterans from VHA who call
VCL, VA's suicide telephone hotline. While the Quality Enhancement Research Initiative
(QUERI) funded partnered evaluation of this program is planned for three years (FY
2020 - FY 2023), the Caring Letters program, in which Veterans will receive letters over
the course of a year after their call, is intended to become a permanent part of VCL care
for callers.
Study objective: This evaluation aims to determine the effects of Caring Letters on care
utilization, mental health outcomes and suicide behaviors of VCL callers, identify
facilitators and barriers to program implementation and conduct a budget analysis of
program costs.
The primary aim of this evaluation is to evaluate the effects of Caring Letters on clinical
outcomes (including incidence of VA-documented suicide attempts) and clinical
utilization rates (including VA inpatient mental health hospitalization and outpatient
mental health utilization). An additional exploratory aim will be to examine rates of all-
cause mortality and suicide for Veterans who receive Caring Letters compared to the
comparison cohort of Veterans from the two years prior to the launch of the Caring
Letters campaign. Since this is a new population for the use of the intervention, the
project will also evaluate the effects of two different Caring Letter signatories (VA
Counselor and a Peer Veteran) by randomizing each enrolled Veteran to one of two
conditions. The evaluation will also examine facilitators and barriers to implementing the
Caring Letters program using the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption,
Implementation, Maintenance) framework and will include budget impact analyses.
Study design and data sources: As an effectiveness-implementation hybrid design this
evaluation focuses on both clinical effectiveness and implementation goals. This
evaluation includes a randomized and a non-randomized component. In the randomized
portion of the study, all Veterans who meet the inclusion criteria will receive nine caring,
non-demanding letters over the course of a year following their call to VCL, randomized
by signatory (by provider or by peer). Participants were included in the evaluation cohort
if they called VCL during the evaluation period (6/22/2020 - 6/30/2021) and were an
identifiable VCL caller (e.g., not an anonymous caller); had a valid mailing address on
file with the VA; and were calling about themselves (i.e., not calling about a loved one).
Quantitative and qualitative analyses will be conducted. Quantitative data sources will
consist of secondary VA data that are collected as a part of routine care and/or clinical
management. These include the VCL data repository, Corporate Data Warehouse
(CDW), suicide attempt data and DOD-VA Suicide Data Repository and mortality data.
Qualitative data sources include program documentation content analysis for
Page 14 of 45
VA FY 2023 Annual Evaluation Plan
implementation evaluation, as well as surveys and stakeholder interviews that include
Veterans' perspectives.
In the non-randomized portion of the study, clinical outcomes and clinical utilization will
be compared among Veterans who called the VCL after June 2020 (when Caring
Contacts began to be mailed) and among Veterans who called the VCL from June 2018
to May 2020. This pre-post design will provide data on differences in outcomes among
VCL callers who do and do not receive letters.
Analysis: For the randomized portion of the evaluation (comparison of letter signatory),
differences in outcomes for pre-post and signatory comparisons will be analyzed with
chi-square tests, a Wilcoxon rank-sum test, logistic regression, zero-inflated Poisson, or
negative binomial models. Analysis for this intervention utilizes the RE-AIM framework.
For the non-randomized portion of the evaluation (comparison of letters VS no letters),
evaluators will compare outcomes among the randomized cohort to outcomes from a
matched comparison cohort of VCL callers from two years prior to the program's launch
in 2020. Outcomes will be assessed using VHA administrative data. Differences in
outcomes will be analyzed with chi-square tests, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, logistic
regression, zero-inflated Poisson, or negative binomial models.
Evaluators will assess the program's reach by measuring the total number of eligible
Veterans as well as the number reached. Analyses will include the number of cards
sent, the number of undeliverable cards, as well as the number of opt-outs. Data will be
compiled into a master file in CDW, pulled from a backup of the VCL database
(Medora), postal receipt information provided by the printing contractor and opt-out
feedback provided to the general e-mail or the VA311/VCL line.
Ongoing effectiveness analyses will examine increased use of resources, incidence and
frequency of documented suicide attempts, rates of inpatient mental health
hospitalization, emergency department visits and engagement in mental health care.
Upon completion of the evaluation period, effectiveness analyses will look at rates of
suicide and all-cause mortality as well (suicide analyses will be delayed due to standard
delays in the availability of national cause of death data). Maintenance analyses will
determine guidance and recommendations for sustainability and future VA use of the
Caring Letters program.
An additional budget impact analysis will incorporate the cost of materials, staff time
devoted to launching and maintaining the program and pre- and post-intervention
comparisons of care utilization, to determine the mean costs of the program, measured
by patient/month.
A qualitative analysis component will provide insight into the effectiveness of the
intervention at different points in the evaluation and will be used to track implementation
barriers and facilitators. As part of the stakeholder interview process evaluators will
inquire about the perceived helpfulness of the letters and Veterans will self-report on
their care and resources. This data will be provided to VCL for continued program
quality improvement.
Anticipated challenges: A significant challenge of this intervention is being able to
isolate the impact of the intervention from the effect of COVID-19 on outcomes among
Page 15 of 45
VA FY 2023 Annual Evaluation Plan
VCL callers. Pandemic aside, because this is the largest implementation of a Caring
Contacts project to date, logistics of continuously enrolling a large number of patients
into the intervention will require careful coordination between the different groups
involved working on participant data design and tracking, program implementation,
printing and qualitative/quantitative evaluation.
Dissemination: Regular quarterly reports on the intervention's reach will be compiled
and provided to VA leadership, particularly the Office of Mental Health and Suicide
Prevention (OMHSP). Insights on the program's impacts, as well as associated costs,
can be used to guide future implementation at the local and regional levels. Once the
program evaluation is complete, the evaluation team will share findings with the key
stakeholders. We will also tailor results reporting in consultation with communication
leads to reach a broader audience of Veterans through media and publications. Since
this will be the largest Caring Letters program to date, the results of this evaluation will
also inform Caring Letters programs within and beyond the VCL and VA system.
Additional dissemination activities will include peer-reviewed journal articles and
promotional materials developed by the Center for Information Dissemination and
Education Resources (CIDER), a QUERI resource center.

B.2 Clinical Informatics and Data Management Office (CIDMO)
Learning Agenda Question: What strategies work best to prevent suicide among
Veterans?
Evaluation Question: How do facility-level differences in mental health staffing and
operations impact mental health access, utilization and outcomes?
Timeline: The CIDMO project began in FY 2020 and is expected to continue in
upcoming fiscal years.
Background: Suicide was the tenth leading cause of death in the United States in 2018.
Though they represent only 5 percent of the total population, Veterans die by suicide at
a disproportionately high rate, accounting for more than 13 percent of all deaths by
suicide. The risk to Veterans is highest in the first two years post-discharge and remains
persistently high in the six years following military service.ix Nearly 60% of the Veterans
who died by suicide in 2017 had been diagnosed with a mental health condition in the
past two years, making improving the continuity of mental health care for transitioning
Veterans a key lever for suicide prevention. To help address this issue and assist
Servicemembers transition to VA care, VA, Department of Defense (DoD) and
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) implemented the Joint Action Plan that
expands access to mental health treatment and suicide prevention services during the
first year post-service.X
Study objective: The study objective is to estimate causal effects of mental health
capacity, both in and outside of VHA and efficiency, on engagement in mental health
care among a cohort of recently separated Veterans, as well as on the likelihood of a
Veteran experiencing a suicide-related event (SRE) or other serious adverse event
(SAE). This information has rich practical application to key operational issues such as
optimal size of a mental health clinic, clinic efficiency improvements and the geographic
distribution of resources.
Study design and data sources: The evaluation uses econometric methods to develop a
value analysis model and planning framework for Veterans' mental health care. The
model estimates changes in mental health treatment engagement and SREs/SAEs
among Veterans seeking care facilities with varying levels of mental health staffing. The
project employs data from numerous sources including the VHA Corporate Data
Warehouse (CDW) and Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs
Infrastructure for Clinical Intelligence (DaVINCI). Analysis of SREs and SAEs relies on
data from VA surveillance systems, including the VA-Suicide Prevention and Application
Network (SPAN), the Comprehensive Suicide Risk Evaluation (CSRE) and the Suicide
Behavior and Overdose Report (SBOR).
Analysis: The project focuses on developing metrics to identify measures of value
relating mental health staffing to two specific outcomes: treatment engagement and
SREs/SAEs. When evaluating engagement in mental health treatment among recently
separated Veterans, the evaluation has two outcomes of interest: engagement within
the first 12 months post-discharge and time to first engagement. The evaluation will
utilize descriptive analysis and discrete time hazard models with instrumental variables
Page 18 of 45
VA FY 2023 Annual Evaluation Plan
to introduce exogenous variation in mental health capacity and efficiency. In addition,
the evaluators will control for individual- and area-level characteristics.
Relative to the analysis of SREs and SAEs, evaluators are working to refine initial
modeling efforts. As suicide mortality is relatively rare within the datasets being utilized,
the analysis of SREs/SAEs is critical as they are inextricably linked to mental health.
The project identifies SREs as being inclusive of death by suicide, suicide attempts,
suicidal self-directed violence and undetermined self-directed violence. These events
are captured through numerous surveillance systems which rely on accurate reporting
and documentation. The evaluators will use instrumental variable analysis to correct for
statistical limitations, such as ascertainment bias, that may arise from the use of these
datasets.
Anticipated challenges: The primary challenges encountered and anticipated are
statistical limitations inherent to the datasets under analysis. First, evaluators are
working to address the issue of ascertainment bias associated with the recording of
mental health outcomes. Ascertainment bias poses a significant challenge as outcomes
(SREs) are only recorded to the extent that they are known to providers within the VHA
system. Failing to account for ascertainment bias may result in the model failing to
identify an effect of capacity on SREs.
The evaluators also anticipate other methodological challenges relative to facility-level
differences. For example, operational practices may vary from facility to facility in ways
that are difficult to assess via administrative data, as well as differences in the collection
and documentation of that data. Similarly, it will be difficult to fully account for regional
differences in community need for mental health treatment services.
Dissemination: Since implementation, evaluators have disseminated findings to both
research and operational partners. This practice will continue as the evaluation
progresses. Evaluators also plan to share findings through academic, peer-reviewed
journals, as well as presentations at relevant subject matter conferences.

C. Opioids and Substance Use Disorder
C.1 The Stratification Tool for Opioid Risk Mitigation (STORM)
Learning Agenda Question: How can VHA provide clinically appropriate pain
management to Veterans while simultaneously decreasing dependence on opioids?
Evaluation Questions:
1. Does STORM improve opioid safety, as measured by the probability that a patient
experiences a serious adverse event?
2. Do patient outcomes differ when STORM policy language outlines consequences
for failing to meet minimal case review targets?
Timeline: Initial evaluation completed in FY 2020; evaluation extension anticipated
through FY 2023.
Background: The opioid epidemic has ravaged communities in the United States, with
Veterans facing an increased likelihood of developing opioid use disorder (OUD) due to
a variety of unique military stressors. xii, xiii,xiv In 2018, over 900,000 Veterans treated in
VHA had an opioid prescription. XV,XVi VA developed the Stratification Tool for Opioid Risk
Mitigation (STORM) in 2017 to help clinical providers better identify Veterans who might
Page 21 of 45
VA FY 2023 Annual Evaluation Plan
be particularly vulnerable to negative opioid-related outcomes. xvii VA issued a policy
notice that required clinicians to conduct case reviews and identify appropriate risk
mitigation strategies for patients who were identified as high-risk for opioid-related
adverse events by STORM.XVili
Study objective: The STORM evaluation is a multiyear effort that aims to determine if
the use of the STORM tool decreases the rate of opioid-related adverse outcomes and
whether the inclusion of consequences for failing to meet the minimum case review
target would affect both the behavior of VHA providers and the opioid-related adverse
event rate.
Study design and data sources: The evaluation is an interventional, cluster randomized
trial that uses a stepped-wedge design to measure both the effectiveness of VHA's case
review policy and the STORM dashboard in identifying patients at a high-risk of opioid-
related serious adverse events (SAEs). Demographic, diagnostic, pharmacy and health
care utilization data are pulled from the VHA Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW).
Analysis: The evaluation includes two interventions. In the first intervention, VHA
facilities are required to review patients with different risk levels as identified by the
STORM tool. For the first nine months of the evaluation, the facilities include patients in
the top 1% of risk. After that, half the facilities are randomly selected to increase their
case review load to include patients identified in the top 5% of risk. All participating VHA
facilities case review rates are reviewed using VHA administrative data 18 months after
the initial start date.
In the second intervention, VHA facilities are randomly selected into two groups. One
group will receive a policy memo indicating consequences if case review completion
targets are not met, the other will receive a memo without any mention of the
consequences. Like the first part of the evaluation, participants' case review rates are
reviewed using VHA administrative data 18 months after initiation.
The primary outcome variables measured for both interventions are opioid-related SAEs
- opioid overdose, accidental falls and possible and confirmed suicide attempts - which
will be identified using ICD-10 codes. The rate of opioid related SAEs will be compared
between a treatment group (high risk patients as identified by the STORM dashboard)
and a control group (patients who were not displayed on the dashboard) over the
course of two years. Patients are censored from the study if they experience one of the
SAEs, die, or leave the study.
The data is analyzed using an intention-to-treat approach with patient-month-level
survival analysis for both parts of the evaluation (effectiveness of policy memo and
effectiveness of the STORM tool).
The evaluators will conduct quantitative analyses to evaluate the effects of the differing
policy approaches and patient inclusion on the STORM tool's high-risk list on time to
first opioid-related SAE, using data from the dashboard and CDW. The evaluators will
examine the consequences of expanding the risk strata at each step wedge on patient
load, case review rates and risk mitigation rates. These findings will help inform future
policy roll outs and implementation initiatives.
Page 22 of 45
VA FY 2023 Annual Evaluation Plan
Evaluators will also conduct exploratory analyses in addition to the analyses outlined in
the clinical trial protocol. These additional analyses will seek to understand (1) whether
there are any racial/ethnic disparities in outcomes among individuals in the top 5% of
high-risk patients, (2) the impact of the STORM roll-out on provider practice patterns
and (3) the impact of the STORM roll-out on outcomes for patients diagnosed with
OUD.
Anticipated challenges: Evaluators found that the expansion of case review
requirements, from the top 1% of high-risk patients to the top 5% of high-risk patients,
dramatically increased mental health providers' workload. If the STORM dashboard is
implemented at this level with no additional changes (e.g., additional staffing), this could
pose a challenge for mental health providers in the future, potentially leading to provider
burnout. Another notable challenge to this work is that VHA is unable to observe
prescriptions and opioid-related adverse events that occur outside of the VHA system.
This knowledge gap and how it impacts STORM, will likely be an area of future study.
Dissemination: Evaluators have presented the evaluation protocol at the 2017 Academy
Health National Health Policy Conference and as a VHA cyber-seminar in 2020. The
findings from the evaluation were presented by poster at the RX Summit in April 2021
and were presented at the Academy Health Annual Research Meeting in June 2021,
where one of the abstracts was chosen as best of conference. In addition, they have
also published research articles in peer-reviewed journals showcasing the design and
protocol of the study and have presented findings, internally, to VA researchers,
physicians and policy makers. Dissemination efforts will be updated as more results
become available.

C.2 Post-Incarceration Engagement (PIE)
Learning Agenda Question: How can VHA provide clinically appropriate pain
management to Veterans, especially those from underserved and marginalized
populations, while simultaneously decreasing dependence on opioids?
Page 23 of 45
VA FY 2023 Annual Evaluation Plan
Evaluation Questions:
1. Does PIE improve linkage with and engagement in mental health and substance
use treatment and housing for reentry Veterans?
2. Is there an association between peer specialist fidelity to the PIE model and the
use of higher intensity implementation strategies?
Timeline: The current iteration of the PIE program launched in FY 2021 and will run
through FY 2025.
Background:
Justice-involved populations, including Veterans, have a considerable burden of chronic
physical and behavioral health conditions including alcohol use disorder, mental illness
and SUD. xix,xx,xxi The risk of homelessness is high, with 30% experiencing some
homelessness post-release, compared to 6% among the general population of adult
men.xxii The VA's Health Care for Re-Entry Veterans (HCRV) specialists assess needs
pre-release, link VA-eligible Veterans with appropriate services including housing and
treatment for mental health and substance use disorders upon release and provide
short-term case management post-release.
Many of the Veterans in the HCRV program have mental health and/or substance use
disorders. The HCRV program is designed to promote successful community
reintegration and to prevent homelessness upon release. A retrospective study of
Veterans who had an HCRV outreach visit in fiscal years 2008-2013 found that 57%
had been diagnosed with a mental health disorder, 47% had a substance use disorder
and 35% had both.XXiii
The PIE program was designed to add a peer support component to HCRV services
and to integrate these peer services into HCRV to provide more comprehensive support
for reentry Veterans. PIE is an enhancement to VA's HCRV program. PIE complements
the existing HCRV service array through the addition of intensive peer support
specialists who can help bridge resources and services across multiple contexts
including correctional facilities, community-based organizations and VA. Working with
HCRV specialists, peer specialists assist reentry Veterans leaving prison or jail to
connect with VA and the community resources they need. PIE peer specialists can help
Veterans with pre-release planning, provide day of release support (including transport
from the prison or jail to parole/probation and to their pre-arranged housing) and then
deliver tailored services post-release for approximately 6-12 months.
PIE was one of four innovative practices that was pilot tested as part of the VA Bridging
the Care Continuum Quality Enhancement Research Initiative (Bridge QUERI) program
from 2015-2020. Bridge QUERI sought to improve the health of vulnerable Veterans by
improving diagnosis, outreach, linkage and engagement with specialty care. Evaluation
of the PIE program found that when compared with a historical comparison group,
participants in the PIE intervention were significantly more likely to receive substance
use treatment (86% vs 19%, p<.0001) and to be engaged in mental health services
(93% versus 64%, p<.003). The recidivism rate for the 43 male Massachusetts PIE
participants who were released less than one year from prison or jail was 7% compared
with the statewide rate of 17% for those released from prisons run by the
Page 24 of 45
VA FY 2023 Annual Evaluation Plan
Massachusetts Department of Correction in 2016, the most recent year that data are
available. xxiv In addition, most of the PIE participants achieved permanent housing.
The PIE intervention is grounded in a growing body of evidence regarding the role of
peer-specialists in efforts to help link and support engagement in health care and
community support services. XXV A cluster randomized controlled trial (cRCT) involving
Veterans with mental illness showed greater improvement in patient activation
(knowledge, skill, confidence and attitudes for managing health and treatment) in
Veterans with peers on their case management teams, compared to Veterans whose
case management teams did not have a peer. xxvi Eleven studies conducted outside VA,
including RCTs, quasi-experimental and correlational studies, have shown
improvements in hospitalization rates, treatment engagement, appointment no-shows,
social functioning and unmet needs through the use of peer support.XXVI PIE seeks to
build on these findings within the justice-involved Veteran population.
Study objective:
PIE aims to improve access to and engagement in mental health and substance use
treatment services, with the goal of ultimately reducing homelessness and the likelihood
that Veterans being released from jails and prisons will commit crimes in the future. To
achieve this, PIE will first identify pre-implementation barriers to adopting PIE and adapt
implementation strategies for each of the six sites that are implementing the PIE model.
Second, PIE will evaluate the effectiveness of high- versus low-intensity implementation
strategies on Veteran engagement with services and on fidelity to the model. Each site
will begin with a low intensity, baseline implementation strategy (educational
outreach/academic detailing) and in successive waves will add a higher intensity
implementation (facilitation) on a rolling basis. Finally, PIE will develop an
Implementation Playbook that may sustain the PIE peer support model and may be
adopted by VAs to enhance services and outcomes for Veterans leaving incarceration.
Study design and data sources:
The study will use a stepped wedge implementation-effectiveness study design to
examine both effectiveness of PIE as an intervention by assessing barriers to
implementation, as well as the effectiveness of the implementation strategies at
instituting and sustaining the PIE intervention at the site by evaluating the effectiveness
of high- versus low-intensity implementation strategies on Veteran engagement with
services and on fidelity to the mode.
PIE will be implemented in six VA medical centers across the U.S. for a minimum of 18
months with additional time for follow-up evaluation. Implementation will be staggered at
the six sites and began in FY 2021 and is expected to continue through FY 2025. The
PIE program will be embedded with VA medical centers' Veterans Justice Programs,
which includes HCRV as well as and Veterans Justice Outreach (VJO) program.
Additionally, in three of the six sites, the Housing Urban Development - Veterans Affairs
Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) program will also be involved in the PIE
implementation. In those sites, the peer support specialist will function as an
interdisciplinary member of the HUD-VASH team and will be trained in the PIE model as
well as the HUD-VASH program.
Page 25 of 45
VA FY 2023 Annual Evaluation Plan
Aim 1. PIE utilizes Rapid Assessment, Response and Evaluation (RARE) processes in
each of the six PIE sites to 1) understand the practice setting and ecological system in
which it operates and 2) determine whether adaptations will need to be made to the
implementation strategies or the evidence-based practice. The RARE model leverages
qualitative and quantitative research methods to facilitate both process evaluation as
well as rapid iteration of the PIE intervention as necessary. Formative qualitative
interviews will be conducted with key stakeholders including HCRV case managers at
each site and with HUD-VASH staff at the sites using a hybrid HUD-VASH/HCRV peer
to better understand the context.
Aim 2. PIE utilizes a Hybrid Type III effectiveness-implementation cluster randomized
stepped wedge trial. Instead of starting all intervention and control sites together, this
design staggers the introduction of the implementation strategies such that all sites
begin with low intensity implementation strategies and after approximately six months
move into higher intensity implementation strategies in successive waves (three waves
of two sites each). Evaluators anticipate that higher intensity implementation strategies
will result in increased fidelity to the intervention and may result in greater linkage and
engagement with appropriate treatment and housing services.
For implementation strategy tracking, Computerized Patient Record System notes
(which include a template for entering PIE-related fidelity information) entered by the
peer support specialist will be audited and then documented work will be summarized
for each site monthly. Regular audits and feedback will allow evaluators to assess
fidelity and consistency to the model. To gather information on effectiveness outcomes,
including data on healthcare usage, overdose rates and linkage to permanent housing,
data from the CDW and Homeless Operations Management and Evaluation System
(HOMES) will be utilized. Additionally, the VINElink website will be used for information
on criminal recidivism.
Analysis:
Aim 1. PIE will use rapid analysis techniques, using brief summaries of interview audio
recordings or interview notes and data templates to summarize unique elements of
each practice setting and ecological system which may need adaptation. These data will
be used by the PIE team to make fidelity consistent adjustments for each site including
changes in implementation strategies and in some cases elements of the intervention
itself.
Aim 2. Effectiveness outcomes will be assessed using the standard modeling approach
for analysis of stepped wedge designs as described by Hussey and Hughes.XXViii
Specifically, PIE will estimate the effect of transitioning to a higher-intensity
implementation strategy from a baseline low intensity strategy on each effectiveness
outcome using mixed effects regression models. The covariate of primary interest will
be a fixed effect for the implementation strategy and models will include a fixed effect to
account for temporal trends and a random effect for study site to account for clustering
of individuals within sites. The specific functional form of these models will depend on
the distribution of the outcome of interest (e.g., logistic models for dichotomous
outcomes; linear models for continuous outcomes). PIE will examine within-site
changes in outcome measures evaluated under the proposed design.
Page 26 of 45
VA FY 2023 Annual Evaluation Plan
In addition to assessing within-site changes in these measures and while accounting for
similarities/differences in site-level characteristics across participating sites, PIE will
take advantage of the cascading implementation start times of the stepped wedge
design to (i) cross-sectionally compare sites that are undergoing versus yet to undergo
implementation and (ii) examine the impact of secular trends on the observed changes
in the measures.
Anticipated challenges:
PIE anticipates several challenges as the evaluation progresses. First, there are
concerns that the number of in-person visits between peer support specialists and
Veterans might be limited by external factors, in particular the COVID-19 public health
emergency and the geographic distance between veterans and peer specialists. In
addition, the rules of the local correctional facility may determine and impact pre-release
visits as well as the ability to transport on the day of release. From an internal
operations standpoint, the ability to hire, train and onboard peer support specialists
expediently is a concern. Lastly, the collaboration with HUD-VASH is a new aspect of
the PIE program and as such will require time before it is optimized.
Dissemination: Over the course of the evaluation, the evaluators will update research
and operational partners, with initial reports made in FY 2022Q1. Evaluators plan to
share findings through academic, peer-reviewed journals, as well as presentations at
relevant subject matter conferences.

D. Impact of COVID-19
Learning Agenda Question: How has COVID-19 affected VHA care, including care
delivery and Veteran health outcomes such as all-cause mortality?
Evaluation Questions:
1. How did the COVID-19 pandemic affect all-cause Veteran mortality?
2. How did the COVID-19 pandemic affect virtual care utilization?
3. Did virtual care utilization moderate the relationship between COVID-19 and
Veteran mortality?
Timeline: The evaluation started in FY 2021 and will run through FY 2024.
Background: As the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the world at
large, Veterans of the US Armed Forces are also experiencing increases in morbidity
and mortality due to the virus. The Veteran population may be at higher risk than the
general population, due to their higher comorbidity burden and average age which have
been associated with severe COVID-19 illness. xxix,xx
Nationally, studies estimate that
all-cause mortality among the general population increased by approximately 20% from
March to October 2020. xxxi These provisional estimates are based on nationwide age
distributions, prevalence rates and historical mortality. However, there is a dearth of
research using individual-level data or on sub-national excess mortality estimates.
The COVID-19 pandemic presented a challenge for VA, requiring VA to lean heavily on
virtual care rather than face-to-face care so it could continue serving Veterans safely. xxxii
Going forward, it is important to understand how virtual care has affected health care
delivery, how it has contributed to the health outcomes of Veterans, as well as the
extent to which virtual care utilization has changed over time and across VA sites during
the COVID-19 public health emergency. The pandemic presents a natural experiment
and grants the ability to observe both the consequences of stalled routine/elective care
for Veterans' short- and long-term health outcomes and the role of virtual care in
mitigating those
Study objective(s): The Partnered Evidence-based Policy Resource Center (PEPReC)
COVID-19 evaluation is a multiyear effort to determine impact of the pandemic on all-
cause Veteran mortality and virtual care utilization. PEPReC will assess whether the
Page 29 of 45
VA FY 2023 Annual Evaluation Plan
transition from in-person to virtual care utilization moderated the relationship between
COVID-19 and excess mortality in 2020, in addition to assessing differences among the
urban and rural populations.
Study design and data sources: Data on Veteran-level demographics, health services
utilization, comorbidities and dates of death will be obtained from the CDW, which
incorporates death data from the Veterans Benefits Administration and Social Security
Administration (SSA). Data on county-level COVID-19 deaths and confirmed cases will
be extracted from Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center, as well as
hospital-level COVID-19 capacity data recently made public by the Department of
Health and Human Services. xxxiv,xxxy
In the first phase of the evaluation, PEPReC will develop county-level predictive models
for Veteran mortality using data from 2015-2019 and apply estimates to data from 2020.
Differences in observed and estimated probability of death will produce estimates of
excess mortality among Veterans associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Results will
be validated against county-level COVID-19 burden (i.e., confirmed cases and deaths).
A priori, it is expected that counties with greater excess mortality in 2020 will also
experience greater COVID-19 burden, on average.
During the second phase, PEPReC will examine changes in Veterans' access to care
(e.g., wait times, satisfaction) and health services utilization during the pandemic, with a
specific focus on virtual care. Evaluators will identify facility-level variation in the timing
of the transition from in-person to virtual care, the volume of virtual care and the COVID-
19 burden within each facility's catchment area will be assessed. The variation in
county-level COVID-19 burden will be leveraged as a natural experiment to identify
whether facilities with greater adoption of virtual care experience fewer excess deaths
on average, compared to facilities with similar levels of COVID-19 burden but lower
rates of virtual care adoption. Analyses will control for historical trends in virtual care
adoption prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Analytic approach: The analysis for the first phase will proceed as follows. First,
evaluators will create a dataset with aggregate mortality at the county-month level using
data from CDW and SSA. This dataset will also include county-year-level summary data
for socio-demographic background (e.g., age, gender, marital status, priority group) and
prevalence of Quan-Elixhauser comorbidities. xxxvi
Second, the 2015-2019 data will
"train" a variety of mortality risk prediction models including negative binomial, Poisson,
quasi-Poisson and generalized estimating equation (GEE) regression models. These
models were chosen because they are either most appropriate for count outcomes
(Poisson), help address issues with overdispersion (negative binomial), or have
statistical properties making them robust to misspecification of correlation structure
(GEE). The best-performing model will be selected using two measures of predictive
validity within the training dataset: mean squared error (MSE) and mean average
prediction error (MAPE). The resulting coefficients from the preferred model will then be
used to generate county-level predictions for 2020; observed mortality will be divided by
expected mortality to generate risk-adjusted observed-to-expected (O/E) ratios.
The next phase will examine sensitivity of these results to various other specifications
and functional forms to ensure that our estimates are robust. Lastly, linear regression
Page 30 of 45
VA FY 2023 Annual Evaluation Plan
models will be used to examine the association between our estimates of excess
mortality among Veterans and county-level measures of COVID-19 burden.
During phase two, the same identification strategy outlined in phase one will be used to
examine an expanded set of outcomes, including virtual-care utilization, in-person
utilization, wait times and patient satisfaction, among others. The work done in the first
phase will validate the approach for characterizing the burden of COVID-19 and how the
pandemic impacted these additional outcomes. Lastly, linear regression models will
again be used to examine the association between our estimates of excess mortality
among Veterans and county-level measures of COVID-19 burden. However, models will
now include a measure of virtual care access (e.g., percentage of pre-COVID in-person
volume that was transitioned to virtual care) and an interaction between the COVID-19
and virtual care measures. This final step will allow evaluators to identify whether the
transition to virtual care moderates the relationship between local COVID-19 burden
and excess Veteran mortality.
Anticipated challenges: There are a few study limitations. First, there are potential
reporting delays in Veteran deaths and a lack of data on confirmed COVID-19
diagnoses, especially in the pandemic's early stages. Cause-of-death data is imported
into the CDW annually and as data tends to lag two years, cause-of-death data is not
available for 2020. Thus, evaluators cannot attribute excess deaths during the
pandemic to specific causes. Analyses will be repeated once these data become
available to decompose excess mortality into those deaths directly related to COVID-19
versus other causes. For sparsely populated rural areas, estimates for changes in
mortality or utilization may be less precise due to the limited number of VA enrollees.
Second, prior to 2020, the use of virtual care was not widespread. In 2020, VA clinics
were required to rapidly adopt and implement this type of care. Evaluators anticipate
that, due to the timeline for implementing virtual care, the data may not be clean or
readily available for all clinics. Thus, documentation of variations in virtual care
utilization (including different modalities) may be limited to areas that do provide clean
data. Moreover, the external validity of our findings may need to rely on stronger
assumptions.
Dissemination: Evaluators will publish research articles in peer-reviewed journals
documenting the impact on Veteran outcomes. They will present findings, both internally
and externally, to researchers, physicians and policymakers. The study design, analytic
code and aggregate county-month dataset will be made available to VA researchers
interested in COVID-19 analyses.

VHA EVALUATION PLANS - UNDER DEVELOPMENT
VHA is constantly expanding its evidence development and evaluation activities into
new research and policy areas. Many of these new endeavors, once finalized, will be
included in future Annual Evaluation Plans. Currently, detailed evaluation plans are
under development, funding is being secured and evaluation partners are being
identified. This Annual Evaluation Plan serves to highlight the Department's advocacy
for such emerging priorities. Below is a summary of preliminary work to develop
evaluations regarding two high-priority topics.
Military Environmental Exposures
Over three million US Servicemembers have deployed to Iraq, Afghanistan, Kuwait,
Qatar, Djibouti, United Arab Emirates, Syria, Kyrgyzstan and surrounding areas since
February 24, 1991 - many of whom had burn pit smoke and other environmental
exposures (e.g., other air pollutants, chemicals, radiation, occupational hazards, warfare
agents) that can lead to poor health outcomes. There is also growing urgency to
address the potential health effects of military environmental exposures of post-9/11
deployed Veterans more proactively and comprehensively.
VHA's Office of Research and Development (ORD) and Office of Patient Care Services,
Health Outcomes Military Exposures (HOME) are focused on investigating the
associations between environmental exposures and long-term health effects and the
Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses Research Advisory Committee recommended to the VA
Secretary a comprehensive clinical research structure to enhance clinical care delivery
and evaluation in this area. Congress also mandated the VA/Department of Defense
(DoD) Airborne Hazards and Open Burn Pit Registry (AHOBPR).
Future VA Annual Evaluation Plans will aim to address the following Learning Agenda
questions:
To what extent have military environmental exposures harmed Veterans during
their period of service, especially regarding latent or chronic adverse health
effects?
What is the impact of the collaborations across the different federal agencies on
the implementation of programs and policies related to military environmental
exposures experienced by Veterans?
What are the best strategies to implement state of the art evaluation and care
models to provide effective care for Veterans exposed to military environmental
exposures?
Current evidence-based practices focus on Veterans who have been harmed from
Agent Orange or diagnosed with different illnesses associated with service in the Gulf
War. Potential evaluation partners for this topic include ORD-affiliated investigators and
evaluations will leverage data included in the AHOBPR, VHA's Corporate Data
Warehouse, DoD Manpower Data Center, CDC and National Academy of Science,
Page 33 of 45
VA FY 2023 Annual Evaluation Plan
Engineering and Medicine. Surveys and clinical assessments are also under
consideration.
Women's Health
Women comprise approximately 17% of current military forces (16% of enlisted and
19% of officers) and approximately 877,000 women served in the military from the start
of military operations after 9/11 through the end of FY 2020. As the fastest growing
segment of the Veteran population, these women Veterans may face challenges with
the existing VA structures that were built around the health and economic needs of men
from prior eras.
Thus, VHA must adapt to ensure women Veterans receive the health care they deserve
- including mental health care and obstetrics/gynecological care - as well as the social
and economic supports they need to thrive. The Quality Enhancement Research
Initiative (QUERI), the VA Office of Women's Health, VA Center for Women Veterans
and other research and operations partners will work together to study how well VHA
serves women Veterans now and where there is room for improvement.
Future Annual Evaluation Plans will aim to address the following Learning Agenda
questions:
How can VHA use virtual care modalities to improve women Veterans' access to
VHA care?
How can VHA ensure women Veterans secure and maintain post-deployment
employment and economic stability?
Ongoing evidence-based practices include a virtual diabetes prevention program and a
post-9/11 women Veterans unemployment analysis. Potential evaluation partners for
this topic include the Salt Lake Clinical Evaluation Center (SALIENCE): QUERI
Women's Health Employment Project and the VA Women's Health Research Network.
Evaluations will include a study conducted in response to the FY 2021 National Defense
Authorization Act and may also leverage data from the CDW.
VBA TOPIC IDENTIFICATION PROCESS
VBA's Approach to Evaluation Identification Linked to VA's Significance Criteria: To
address the poverty element of VA's FY 2022 - 2028 Strategic Plan, all three studies
VBA evaluators will undertake in FY 2023 examine income and employment status as
central measures of interest. VBA examines homelessness in a study focused on the GI
Bill and examines military-to-civilian transition in a study evaluating the Transition
Assistance Program (TAP).
Finally, as part of its efforts to support the President's Executive Order: Advancing
Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal
Government, VBA is taking steps to ensure that each of its evaluations sufficiently
include demographic categories that can reveal if program delivery and outcomes are
equitable. Specific plans note where efforts will be taken to expand administrative data
to account for these demographics.

VBA EVALUATION PLANS
Topic Nomination: In FY 2023, VBA will focus its evaluation efforts on military-to-civilian
transition and the effects on Veteran well-being. Both studies represent Veteran-facing,
program-focused evaluations of established programs (TAP, the GI Bill and Chapter 31
(Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E), formerly known as Vocational
Rehabilitation and Employment).
A. VR&E Longitudinal Study (PL 110-389, Section 334)
Learning Agenda Question: Does the completion of the Chapter 31 program lead to
more successful post program outcomes as compared to Veterans who discontinue
from the program?
Given VBA's focus on supporting smooth military-to-civilian transitions, there is an
interest in understanding the needs of particular underserved and vulnerable subgroups
during such transitions. As stated in the VBA Strategic Plan, VBA has a commitment to
evaluating this topic to better inform VBA efforts to provide equitable and effective
support to Servicemembers during this crucial time. Related to this work, VBA
completed an extensive literature review of peer-reviewed journals, scientific sources
and scholarly articles, with an emphasis on sources that cover the military-to-civilian
transition, integration and reintegration into civilian social structures, transition stress,
community reintegration and support structures, identity and military culture,
engagement of Servicemembers and Veterans and user-oriented design. 1 In this
analysis, VBA discovered the need for additional research focused on particular
transition needs and new challenges. The review also identified the need to better
understand the applicability of skills obtained from the military experience to the civilian
context. Recommended research also includes the construct of working with
transitioning Servicemembers as a family unit both pre-and post-separation.

VA FY 2023 Annual Evaluation Plan
Evaluation Question: What significant differences in post program outcomes (i.e.
income, home-ownership, employment) exist between those completing the Chapter 31
program compared to those who leave the program voluntarily?
Timeline: Ongoing; The Congressionally mandated Longitudinal Study is a 20-year
study. Cohort 1 (FY 2010) has completed 11 years of participation, Cohort Il (FY 2012)
has completed nine (9) years of participation and Cohort III (FY 2014) has completed
seven (7) years of participation. The Longitudinal Study is set to be completed in 2035.
Background: The Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) program, known as the
Chapter 31 program, assists Veterans and Servicemembers with service-connected
disabilities and an employment barrier to prepare for, obtain and maintain suitable
employment. VR&E provides comprehensive services to include vocational
assessment, rehabilitation planning and employment services. For Veterans with
service-connected disabilities so severe they cannot immediately consider work, the
VR&E program offers services to improve their ability to live as independently as
possible in their families and communities.
Study design and data sources: As participants are followed over the 20 years of the
study and as more VR&E participants exit the program, additional information will be
available on the long-term outcomes of Veterans and the key programmatic and
demographic factors influencing these outcomes. The study includes three cohorts and
collects data on gender, age, program track, education, employment and other relevant
factors.
Section 334 of Public Law 110-389 requires VA to report to Congress on 16 specific
data elements. The data elements are listed below for reference. The specific outcomes
of interest in the mandate are employment, income, home ownership and use of
supplemental programs.

Survey Data
A survey questionnaire is distributed to a sample of Longitudinal Study participants at
the beginning of each fiscal year. The domains of interest used to stratify the sample for
the VR&E Longitudinal Survey are gender, age and program track. Participants are
invited to complete the survey initially through an online Web survey and then by mail or
phone over a 12-week period. The survey provides VA with information not available
through VA resources such as employment, homeownership, income and overall
satisfaction with the program. A link is provided to the study's Technical Appendices to
address questions regarding response rates and non-responses.²

At the end of each fiscal year, VR&E provides data on all Longitudinal Study
participants such as claimant participation, outcomes and general demographics. This
information includes such data elements including, but not limited to: case status at the
end of the year, program track, age, gender, serious employment handicap and
combined service-connected disability rating.

Training type for which a subsistence allowance is received
Date of a case status change
Race, gender identity and ethnicity data are currently unavailable to report for this study.
Analysis: With additional data collected over time, VA can examine substantive trends in
outcomes. Specifically, VA will be able to draw comprehensive comparisons between
those who achieved rehabilitation (those who completed a program) and those who
discontinued from the program.
Anticipated challenges: The VR&E Longitudinal Study requires contractual support to
survey participants, analyze data and develop the report to Congress. Contractual
support is dependent on available general operating expense funding. Another
challenge is that the study is not designed to demonstrate causality or the impact of
program participation on outcomes of interest. Instead, the study can provide
information on self-reported outcomes and can examine relationships between
outcomes and program participation, demographic characteristics, or other data points.
Dissemination: The final reports submitted to Congress are available to the public on
the VA website.

B. Post-Separation Transition Assistance Program (PSTAP) Assessment
Outcome Study
Learning Agenda Question: To what extent is VA's Transition Assistance Program
supporting the transition needs of newly separated Veterans and what changes are
needed to improve TAP for future performance?
Evaluation Questions: Investigators will seek to answer the following questions:
1. To what degree do Transitioning Servicemembers (TSMs) who participate in
TAP experience life satisfaction and positive/negative short-term and long-term
outcomes?
2.
Is TAP effective in preparing TSMs for their transition, measured at three
checkpoints by the cross-sectional portion (six months/12 months and 36
months post separation)?
3.
Is TAP effective in preparing TSMs for their transition as they progress through
their transition journey, measured by the longitudinal portion?
4.
What effect does TAP participation have on Veterans in the six life domains
(employment, education, health, relationships, finances and well-being).
5.
Does the full TAP training increase Veterans' knowledge, awareness and
access to benefits and services available to them? How can VA and the
interagency partners modify/revise training and/or operational activities aimed at
enhancing the knowledge, awareness and access to benefits and services
available to Veterans?
Timeline: FY 2023
Background: Transition Assistance Program (TAP) - Each year, approximately 250,000
Servicemembers transition from military to civilian life in the United States. While each
transition is different, some of the most common issues facing newly separated
Servicemembers include: 1) Reconnecting with family; 2) Entering the workforce; and 3)
Enrolling in VA benefits and service programs.
TAP is delivered through the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) in cooperation with VA,
the Departments of Labor (DOL), Education (ED), Homeland Security (DHS), the Small
Business Administration (SBA) and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). TAP
provides a cohesive and outcomes-based program that standardizes the transition
process and better prepares Servicemembers to achieve successful outcomes in their
post-military lives.
Page 39 of 45
VA FY 2023 Annual Evaluation Plan
Study objective: The objective of the study is to aid VA in the continual improvement of
TAP and ensure TSMs receive the information on benefits and services they need in the
most effective manner to improve their short and long-term outcomes in the life domains
of employment, education, health, relationships, finances and well-being.
Study design and data sources: The PSTAP is comprised of two separate assessment
instruments currently in use (initial survey launched in June of 2019) used to assess
TAP as well as provide holistic feedback and information used to improve transition and
other VA activities.
1. Annual cross-sectional survey of three cohorts that provides a point-in-time set
of results across the post-separation space
2. Annual longitudinal survey of Veterans that "opt-in" to be part of a longer-term
study from a cross-sectional survey that provides trends over time and more
focused investigation. PSTAP reports are located at: VBA's PSTAP Reports.
PSTAP uses various analytical methods to develop the reports/findings, such as
statistical modeling and regression analysis on various sections to determine the
relative importance and weight of the information to Veterans. Regression analysis is
conducted to identify which courses have the most impact on increasing satisfaction
with TAP. An additional regression model is run on the entire respondent population to
identify possible demographic differences that may influence satisfaction with TAP. To
understand the factors that have a significant impact on the transition of Veterans to
civilian employment and their relationship to TAP, a statistical model was built using
logistic regression. The model analyzes which challenges were most impactful to
Veterans' overall satisfaction with TAP using the question: "Overall, the program was
beneficial in helping me gain the information and skills I needed to prepare me for my
transition and post-military life".
Analysis: VA and other agency's administrative data will be combined to provide a
holistic profile of Veterans' transition and their long-term outcomes.
Cross-Sectional Survey:
Given every year to a different two-month group of Veterans at three time
frames: six months, 12 months and 36 months post-separation
Provides point-in-time results on all the life domains, and how the utility of
TAP/VA Benefits and Service usage impacts general long-term outcomes
Longitudinal Survey:
Given each year to the same group of Veterans based upon the voluntary
participation of the cross-sectional cohort
Provides information over time as to how each Veteran is progressing
across their personal transition and how the utility of TAP/VA Benefits and
Service usage impacts their specific long-term outcomes
The two surveys have sections dedicated to evaluating the delivery, content and utility
of the information received during the TAP classes using batteries of Likert scale
questions. The questions are modeled on the Transition Assistance Participant
Page 40 of 45
VA FY 2023 Annual Evaluation Plan
Assessment given to TSMs after they take the TAP classes prior to separation from
military service.
The PSTAP TAP evaluation section utilizes the following relevant questions for the
overall TAP experience:
1. TAP evaluation section top line question on a Likert scale response: "To
what extent do you agree or disagree with each of the following statements
about TAP?"
a. Overall, the program was beneficial in helping me gain the information
and skills I needed to prepare me for my transition and post-military
life.
b. Overall, the program enhanced my confidence in transition planning.
C. Overall, I used what I learned from the program during my transition.
These questions are analyzed individually as well as aggregated to provide an overall
assessment of the program as indicated by the PSTAP participants. Overall utility
during transition is captured in a separate Likert scale question for each TAP module;
"When considering the course information for each TAP module, how useful was the
content during your transition?"
Additionally, the two surveys (cross-sectional and longitudinal) also contain more in-
depth Likert scale questions specifically about the VA portion of TAP to garner a deeper
understanding of the VA course and ensure it is meeting TSM needs. The questions in
this section assess how well the VA TAP course addresses overall understanding of VA
benefits and services for both the Veteran and their family, how to apply for benefits,
preparing for economic well-being, changes in personal life, homelessness prevention,
obtaining VA health and mental health care.
Both surveys also ask the participants what benefits they have applied for or intend to
apply for in the future.
The data regarding life satisfaction is gathered using several batteries of Likert scale
question that address individual aspects that contribute to life satisfaction as well as
several direct questions soliciting participants feedback on their life satisfaction:
1. Section header for satisfaction: "Now we would like to ask some final
questions about your overall satisfaction and well-being"
2. Main direct question: "Thinking about your own life and personal
circumstances, how satisfied are you with your life as a whole?'
3. Overall battery covers satisfaction with:
a. Standard of living
b. Health
C. Life achievement
d. Personal relationships
e. Feeling of safety
f.
Community integration
g. Future security
h. Spirituality or religion

VA FY 2023 Annual Evaluation Plan
All these sections are used collectively to evaluate how well TAP and specifically VA's
portion are meeting the needs of the Veterans and where they can be improved.
The PSTAP instruments are comprised of sections to investigate Veteran information in
each of the life domains, as well as the overall sentiments of TAP. Most questions use a
Likert scale format with several opportunities for free text comments. The questions are
both objective and subjective to ensure a holistic view of the Veteran's transition are
captured. The survey instruments are included in each year's report appendices and are
available at: https://benefits.va.gov/TRANSITION/tap-assessments.asp
The assessment data is also combined with sets of VA administrative data to further
expand the scope of the overview to include information already known to VA, such as
benefit utilization health care enrollment and interactions with all VBA Lines of Business
and a host of other information in VA's databases.
PSTAP analysts constructed weights to conduct a nonresponse bias analysis (NRBA).
Weights adjust the number of responses so that the proportion of survey respondents
by key characteristics matches the proportion in the survey universe. The weights
account for: 1) the probability of selection; 2) potential nonresponse bias. Since PSTAP
was a census (that is, all Veterans in each cohort received an invitation to complete the
survey), the probability of selection was the same for all (set to 1). To adjust for
nonresponse, the weights were adjusted for differences in response rates among
groups based on the known characteristics of respondents and non-respondents.
The NRBA compared the characteristics of the survey respondents to the entire survey
universe (non-respondents and respondents combined) using administrative data
available for each cohort. The analysis uses both weighted and unweighted data to
check for statistically significant differences between respondents and non-respondents.
This process serves as a check for nonresponse bias, as well as a test of the
effectiveness of the weights in mitigating bias.
Anticipated challenges: None
Dissemination: The PSTAP reports and associated appendices are published each year
to coincide with the following year's execution. The 2020 PSTAP report was released in
June 2021 when the 2021 PSTAP invitations were sent to the participants.
The release is coordinated based on a formal communication plan including a press
release, social media engagement, internal and external stakeholder communications
and VA blogs. The reports/appendices are posted on the Internet at
ittps://benefits.va.gov/TRANSITION/tap-assessments.asp.
