I. INTRODUCTION
The Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018 (Evidence Act) requires agencies to develop an
Annual Evaluation Plan, which describes the "significant" evaluation activities the Agency plans to conduct in the
fiscal year following the year in which it is submitted. Specifically, OMB Circular A-11 (2020) 290-11 states that
"Annual Evaluation Plans offer agencies the opportunity to methodically plan and document their approach to
evaluation and, in particular, how their intended evaluations will support those questions on the agency's learning
agenda that are best answered by evaluation."
USAID implements international development program interventions in Africa, Asia, Middle East, Europe and
Eurasia, and Latin America and the Caribbean. As a result, evaluation functions at USAID are highly
decentralized, with a central office for policy, guidance, and technical assistance. Evaluation is operationalized at
three levels within the Agency. These are (1) Bureau for Policy, Planning, and Learning - Office of Learning
Evaluation and Research (PPL/LER), (2) Washington Regional and Technical Bureaus, and (3) Bilateral and
Regional Missions. The Bureau for Management (M Bureau) leads on management assessments across the
operational platform. Given this decentralized characteristic of the Agency evaluation functions, plans for Agency
evaluations are also decentralized, and this is reflected in the annual evaluation plan of the Agency.
Evaluation is an assessment using systematic data collection and analysis of one or more programs, policies, and
organizations intended to assess their effectiveness and efficiency. Evaluations conducted at USAID follow
established standards that include rigor, transparency, independence and objectivity, relevance and utility, and
ethics. Evaluation is an important source from which evidence is generated for decision making at USAID. As a
result, evidence from evaluations is incorporated into all phases of the Program Cycle, including strategic
planning for overall Country Development Cooperation Strategy (CDCS), and activity planning and design.
Annually, USAID conducts an average of over 150 evaluations. Evaluations are conducted across a broad range of
US Government foreign assistance program areas, including agriculture and food security; democracy, human
rights, and governance; economic growth and trade; education; environment, energy, and infrastructure; gender
equality and women's empowerment; global health; humanitarian assistance; innovation, technology, and
research; and water and sanitation. Based on the USAID Evaluation policy, evaluations at USAID are carried out
for learning and accountability.
This annual evaluation plan provides an overview of USAID significant evaluations that will form the building
blocks for evidence generation and use across the Agency for strategic, programmatic, operational, and
management decision-making. It includes evaluations that USAID operating units are expected to begin or
carried out partially or fully in FY 2023.
I
OMB Circular A-11 (2020) states that "The significance of an evaluation study should be defined by each agency and take into
consideration factors such as the importance of a program or funding stream to the agency mission; the size of the program in terms of
funding or people served; and the extent to which the study will fill an important knowledge gap regarding the program, population(s)
served, or the issue(s) that the program was designed to address."

2.THE AGENCY LEARNING AGENDA (2022 - 2026)
The USAID Agency Learning Agenda (ALA) is an evidence building tool. It is a critical tool that will advance
USAID's policy priorities and demonstrate effectiveness in delivering on the Agency's foreign assistance goals.
USAID is currently updating the ALA to align with the FY2022-FY2026 USAID and Department of State Joint
Strategic Plan and emerging USAID policy priorities. The final version of the ALA will be published in February
2022.
The current emerging priorities of the Agency around which the learning agenda is being developed include,
COVID-19 climate change, strategic engagement, conflict and security, democracy and governance, and diversity,
equity, inclusion, accessibility (DEIA). The draft Agency Learning Agenda has nine questions addressing the
following thematic areas - (1) operational effectiveness; (2) resilience; (3) Responding to Climate Change; (4)
anti-corruption; (5) Affirmative Development; (6) migration and forced displacement; (7) diversity, equity,
inclusion, and accessibility; (8) locally led development; and (9) partnering for sustainability. Below are the
learning agenda questions associated with each thematic area:

3. DEFINITION OF USAID SIGNIFICANT EVALUATIONS
OMB Circular A-11 (2020) states that "the significance of an evaluation study should be defined by each agency
and take into consideration factors such as the importance of a program or funding stream to the agency
mission; the size of the program in terms of funding or people served; and the extent to which the study will fill
an important knowledge gap regarding the program, population(s) served, or the issue(s) that the program was
designed to address. Agencies should clearly state their criteria for designating evaluations as "significant" in their
plans.
For USAID, "significant evaluations" are defined as evaluations that contribute to answering an Agency Learning
Agenda question, AND that are either:
a.
Performance evaluations of activities with a budget of $40 million or more; or
b.
Impact evaluations regardless of budget evaluated; or
c.
Ex-Post evaluations regardless of budget evaluated.
Based on the USAID Evaluation Policy, performance evaluations encompass a broad range of evaluation methods.
They often incorporate before-and-after comparisons, but generally lack a rigorously defined counterfactual.
Performance Evaluations include the following types of evaluations - formative, outcome, process, or
implementation evaluation.
Impact Evaluations measure changes in development outcomes that are attributable to a defined intervention,
program, policy, or organization. Impact evaluations use models of cause and effect and require a credible and
rigorously defined counterfactual to control for factors other than the intervention that might account for
observed changes.
Ex-post evaluations take place after the completion of an activity. Ex-post evaluations offer a unique opportunity
to ask key questions about the sustainability of a particular strategy, project, activity, or intervention after USAID
has ended support.
4. METHODOLOGY FOR IDENTIFYING SIGNIFICANT EVALUATIONS
As already mentioned, USAID has a decentralized structure for planning, designing, and implementing
evaluations. Using the definition above, a significant evaluation data collection tool was developed with the
significant evaluation criteria and shared with USAID Operating Units (OUs) for them to report on significant
evaluations planned for FY 2023. Stakeholders that were engaged in identifying the evaluations included M&E
Points of Contacts (POCs) from USAID Washington Regional and Technical Bureaus, and M&E POCs in the
USAID Missions and OUs. These are usually evaluations that have been identified by the OUs and included in
their performance management plans (PMPs).

5. USAID FY2023 SIGNIFICANT EVALUATIONS
There are 33 significant evaluations of USAID activities, reported by 17 Operating Units (OUs), that are planned
to begin, or will be carried out partially or fully in FY 2023. In terms of the regional distribution, USAID OUs in

evaluations of activities with a

planned to be conducted by OUs in FY 2023. There is currently an effort by USAID to encourage Missions to
consider conducting an impact evaluation, if they design an activity using an untested hypothesis. In addition, an
Agency Notice has been published that the Agency will prefer Missions to conduct impact evaluations when
USAID needs information on whether an intervention is achieving a specific outcome that can be attributed
directly to a USAID intervention.

5.1.1.Agency Learning Agenda Questions
The 28 planned performance evaluations will address seven of the Agency Learning Agenda questions. Figure 5
below shows the learning agenda questions that the performance evaluations will address, by region. The graph
shows that 8 of the 11 performance evaluations that will be conducted in the LAC region will address the
Agency Learning Agenda question on migration and forced displacement. The 11 planned performance evaluation
in Africa, address a wider variety of Agency Evaluation Questions, that include partnering for sustainability,
diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility; anti-corruption; and operational effectiveness.

5.1.2. Evaluation Purpose
According to the OUs, the planned performance evaluations will be conducted for accountability, learning, and
adaptive management. Specifically, the evaluations are expected to assess performance of activities evaluated and
determine the extent to which results are being achieved. For most mid-term evaluations, the evaluations are
expected to identify implementation challenges, if any, and inform corrective actions or adaptations OUs will
have to make to improve implementation and performance outcomes.
5.1.3. Methods and Data Needed
All evaluations are planned to use rigorous performance evaluation methods, which are appropriate to answer
the specific questions that each evaluation will be designed to answer. As indicated in OMB Memo M-21-27" a
randomized controlled trial is not required for an evaluation to be rigorous, and using a method like a
randomized controlled trial does not automatically ensure that an evaluation is conducted with the necessary
rigor." In following OMB guidance, these evaluations will adhere to quality and widely accepted scientific
principles across the evaluation lifecycle from planning and design, through implementation and execution, and
the interpretation and dissemination of findings.
In conducting these performance evaluations, OUs plan to use mixed method approaches that require both
quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis. OUs identified primary and secondary data collection
methods, including literature reviews, population-based surveys, focus group discussions (FGDs), key informant
interviews (KII), and review of performance monitoring data. These methods are expected to be defined further
by the OUs, in FY 2023, as the planning, design, and procurement of the evaluations are finalized. At that point,
the FY 2023 Annual Evaluation Plan will be updated to reflect the details of the evaluation methods for each
evaluation.
5.1.4. Challenges
Several challenges were identified that OUs will have to overcome for the evaluations to be implemented
successfully. The challenges for each evaluation can be found in the Appendices of this plan. Most challenges
identified are contextual, with the potential of impeding data collection activities. The challenges are represented
in Figure 6 below. The most common challenge that is likely to affect more than half of the planned
performance evaluations are restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 response. The second most common
reported were restrictions resulting from the security situation in the countries where the evaluations will be
conducted. This was commonly reported by OUs in the LAC region.

5.1.5 Dissemination Strategy
Following the requirements of ADS 201.3.5.18 the reports of all completed evaluations will be submitted to the
Development Experience Clearinghouse (DEC) within three months of final approval by USAID. In addition to
the required DEC publication of completed evaluation reports, several OUs identified other strategies through
which completed evaluation findings may be disseminated, for example, conducting stakeholder workshops,
hosting learning events, and developing summaries of evaluation reports. In addition, per Agency policy, all
quantitative data collected for each evaluation will be provided in machine-readable, non-proprietary formats as
required by USAID's Open Data policy (see ADS 579). The data will be organized and fully documented for use
by those not fully familiar with
the project or the evaluation.

5.2. IMPACT EVALUATIONS
The second group of significant evaluations is impact evaluations that address an Agency Learning Agenda
question. Impact evaluations measure changes in development outcomes that are attributable to a defined
intervention, program, policy, or organization. Impact evaluations are based on models of cause and effect and
require a credible and rigorously defined counterfactual to control for factors other than the intervention that
might account for observed changes. Impact evaluations can use either an experimental design or
quasi-experimental design.
USAID evaluation policy states that each USAID Mission and Washington OU must conduct an impact evaluation,
if feasible, of any new, untested approach that is anticipated to be expanded in scale or scope through U.S.
Government foreign assistance or other funding sources (i.e., a pilot intervention). However, USAID is currently
encouraging Missions to conduct long-term impact evaluations and providing technical support to build the
capacity of Missions to conduct these evaluations. This includes offering to review the evaluation statements of
work and making technical input to the draft before they are finalized by the Missions. In addition, PPL is also in
the process of finalizing an inter-agency agreement with General Services Administration Office of Government-
wide Policy, Office of Evaluation Sciences (OES), to provide services that require deep expertise in both statistical
and quantitative methods, that USAID Operating Units can easily access for conducting Impact Evaluations.
There are four impact evaluations planned to be conducted in FY2023 that will address an Agency Learning
Agenda question. The OUs that plan to conduct these evaluations include USAID/Jordan, USAID/South Sudan,
USAID/Zambia, and the Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (BHA) in Washington, DC. The activities to be
evaluated are listed in Table 2, below. Details on each of these planned impact evaluations can be found in
Appendix 2 of this plan. Two of the evaluations will be conducted by OUs in Africa, one by an OU in the Middle
East, and one by a Washington, DC, OU. In terms of sectors the impact evaluations that will be conducted by
BHA, USAID/South Sudan, and USAID/Zambia, are for activities implemented in the agriculture and food
security sector, and the impact evaluation that USAID/Jordan will conduct is in the health sector.

5.2.1.Agency Learning Agenda Question
The impact evaluations will address three of the eight Agency Learning Agenda questions. The evaluations that
will be conducted by USAID/Zambia, and USAID/Jordan, will each address the learning agenda question on
resilience, "How can USAID strengthen household, community, and country resilience to climate, conflict,
economic, and health shocks?" The impact evaluations planned by the OUs in South Sudan and BHA will
respectively address questions on operational effectiveness and partnering for sustainability.
5.2.2. Evaluation Purpose
The four impact evaluations are planned for a variety of purposes. For example, USAID/South Sudan will be
conducting the evaluation to determine the effectiveness and efficiency of the pilot Multi-Year Emergency (MYE)
food assistance award as compared to the more traditional single-year humanitarian assistance awards. The
impact evaluation that will be conducted by USAID/Zambia will assess the extent to which HEARTH
interventions on wildlife management and conservation of biodiverse ecosystems improved the well-being and
prosperity of communities that depend on them.
5.2.3. Methods and Data Needed
All of the evaluations are expected to use quasi-experimental impact evaluation designs. The evaluations will be
designed and implemented by independent third-party contractors. For example, BHA expects to use a
matched comparison group design, complemented by qualitative data on project implementation, performance,
and sustainability.
5.2.4. Challenges
Like the other evaluations, OUs provided similar challenges that may affect the implementation of the impact
evaluations. COVID-19 restrictions were identified by South Sudan and Zambia, as a likely challenge that may
affect the evaluation. South Sudan also indicated that there could be security concerns as a challenge for field
data collection. BHA indicated that if the evaluation is conducted during the Ramadan religious season, it will be
a challenge, because it is a period of religious fasting and a challenging period for data collection. Jordan does not
anticipate any challenges to conducting the evaluation. Details for each evaluation are found in the Appendix 2.
5.2.5. Dissemination Strategy
Following the requirements of ADS 201.3.5.18 the reports of all completed evaluations will be submitted to the
Development Experience Clearinghouse (DEC) within three months of final approval by USAID. In addition to
the required DEC publication of completed evaluation reports, several OUs identified other strategies through
which completed evaluation findings may be disseminated. In addition, per Agency policy, all quantitative data
USAID ANNUAL EVALUATION PLAN - FY 2023
14 of 35
collected for each evaluation will be provided in machine-readable, non-proprietary formats as required by
USAID's Open Data policy (see ADS 579). The data will be organized and fully documented for use by those not
fully familiar with the project or the evaluation. USAID will retain ownership of all datasets developed through
these evaluations.
In addition to the mandatory publication of the final report of each evaluation on the DEC, OUs also plan
additional approaches in their dissemination strategy. In Jordan, dissemination will include mission briefs and
summary documentation of the report. South Sudan and BHA's strategy will include hosting webinars on the
evaluation, and Zambia's strategy will include a mission brief as well as hosting a learning event or workshop for
implementing partners and other stakeholders. Details for each evaluation are found in the Appendix 2.
5.3. EX-POST EVALUATIONS
There is one ex-post significant evaluation planned to be conducted in FY 2023 on a health activity. This is the
ex-post evaluation of Maternal and Child Survival Program in Ebonyi and Kogi States of Nigeria. The evaluation
will address the Agency Learning Agenda question on Operational Effectiveness, which is, "How can USAID's
partnerships with the private sector, local and nontraditional partners, and other donors contribute to
sustainable development objectives?"
The purpose of this evaluation is to assess the sustainability of the achievements of the program, beyond USAID
support. The OU expects that the findings of the evaluation will inform how USAID Nigeria programs for
sustainability, and to guide new program designs.
The evaluation is expected to be conducted using mixed methods design, drawing on both quantitative and
qualitative data collection and analysis methods. Specifically, the OU expects to use key informant interviews,
focus group discussions, desk review of program reports, review of routine HMIS data during and post activity
implementation, as some of the sources of data for the evaluation. In terms of challenges in conducting the
evaluation, the OU indicated that COVID-19 and security challenges, may restrict the ability of evaluators to
locate or access those who benefited from the activity during implementation.
In addition to the mandatory publication of the completed evaluation report on the DEC, the OU dissemination
strategy includes hosting a dissemination workshop, and production of Mission Briefs. The evaluations in this
section will be updated when funds for Ex-Post Evaluations based on the Appropriations Act, 2021 become
available to USAID operating units for planning and designing ex-post evaluations.

6. NEXT STEPS:TECHNICAL SUPPORT FROMTHE OFFICE OF
LEARNING, EVALUATION,AND RESEARCH (LER)
In support of the significant evaluations identified in this Annual Evaluation Plan, the USAID Bureau for Policy,
Planning, and Learning, Office of Learning Evaluation and Research (PPL/LER), in collaboration with M&E POCs
and subject matter experts from other Bureaus, will provide virtual and in-person technical and advisory
support, when appropriate, to OUs in the planning, design, procurement, execution, and dissemination of the
results of these evaluations. This is in addition to the ongoing guidance and support that PPL/LER provides to all
USAID OUs, including an online Evaluation Toolkit with templates and guidance, online and in-person training in
monitoring and evaluation practices, and hosting webinars and presentations on evaluation topics.
Depending on need and demand, LER will also provide technical support in conducting evaluability assessments
prior to the design of some of the evaluations (e.g., ex-post evaluations). An evaluability assessment contributes
to decisions about the feasibility of and best approaches for the evaluation.
All significant evaluations will be USAID external evaluations. An external evaluation is one that is commissioned
by USAID, rather than by the implementing partner, and in which the team leader is an expert external to
USAID, who has no fiduciary relationship with the implementing partner. In this regard, LER will provide support
in identifying appropriate contract mechanisms that may be available for Missions to procure services to conduct
the evaluations.
