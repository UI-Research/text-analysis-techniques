U.S. Department of Homeland Security
FY 2021 Capacity Assessment
About this Report
The Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018 ("Evidence Act") requires that the
U.S. Department of Homeland Security conduct and report a capacity assessment describing the
coverage, quality, methods, effectiveness, and independence of evaluation, research, analysis,
and statistics efforts of the Department.
The DHS FY 2021 Capacity Assessment describes the Department's initial effort to assess its
capacity to build and use evidence from evaluation, statistics, research, and analysis, consistent
with implementing guidance from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The capacity
assessment provides a baseline understanding of the Department's strengths and weaknesses
and lays the foundation to improve the infrastructure and culture for evaluation, evidence
building, and organizational learning within DHS.
As required, the DHS FY 2021 Capacity Assessment is published at the DHS public website and
at Evaluation.gov with the Department's other Evidence Act plans and reports.

DHS Capacity Assessment Highlights
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Evaluation Officer in the Division of Program
Analysis & Evaluation (PA&E) oversees periodic assessments of DHS capacity to build and use
evidence, with the aim of helping the Department and its ComponentsÂ¹ identify concrete steps
for continuous improvement. For the fiscal year (FY) 2021 assessment, PA&E developed technical
requirements for a task order awarded to the Homeland Security Operations Analysis Center
(assessment team)2 to design and conduct an actionable assessment.
This assessment included 14 DHS Components in the Department's strategic plan. It reflects data
collected through discussion groups and surveys with selected DHS staff and reviews of evidence
documents. The assessment was designed to advance unity of effort in the Department's
implementation of the Evidence Act and embody a continuous improvement mindset for
assessing and expanding the Department's capacity to produce and use evidence.
PA&E and the assessment team collaborated to develop this summary report of the most
actionable findings. The findings were determined to a great extent by whether personnel whose
input was vital to the capacity assessment were prepared and able to participate in the
assessment, not just as informed respondents but as collaborators on sampling. While the data
were incomplete, the findings from multiple methods and data sources offer insights on baseline
patterns and opportunities to improve capacity for evidence building and use going forward.
Summary of Findings
Conducting the capacity assessment provided an opportunity to discover, describe, and assess
the Department's evidence-building capacity and activities, determining where current evidence
capacity is and is not sufficient to meet future needs and where capacity-building efforts should
be targeted.
Overall DHS lacked shared understanding - common terminology and concepts - related
to
evidence-building as defined by the Evidence Act and OMB. Most Components did not have
coordinated Component-level perspective on staff, funding, and other infrastructure for
evidence building or for evidence-building activities (studies) underway in FY 2021. All four
evidence building activities (i.e., evaluation, research, analysis, and statistics) were underway
across the Department with varying levels of maturity on the assessment dimensions (coverage,
quality, methods, independence, and effectiveness), as summarized in Exhibit 1. Capacity was
uneven across Components, nascent in some places, but developing.
1 This report uses "DHS" or "Department" when referring to the overarching entity of the Department of
Homeland Security (DHS) and "Component" when referring to individual components and offices.
2 This third-party assessment was funded by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and conducted by the
Homeland Security Operational Analysis Center (HSOAC), a Federally Funded Research and Development Center
(FFRDC) operated by the RAND Corporation under contract with the Department of Homeland Security under
Contract #HSHQDC-16-00007 Task Order 7ORDAD21FR0000014. The contents of this publication provide a

Notes: Maturity for the Methods dimension is incorporated in the quality

methods incorporate the necessary level of rigor?"
Coverage Summary Finding: DHS had some staff, funding, and policies in place, and evidence-
building (studies) underway in FY 2021, but they were distributed unevenly across the
Department and considered by many Component representatives to be insufficient to fully
achieve all the objectives defined in the Evidence Act.
Quality Summary Finding: DHS-wide policies and guidance outlined quality standards for some
activities, though compliance with these standards varied across evidence building activities.
Department-level evidence plans were relatively mature. Components did not have equivalent
policies and plans for their evidence building activities. FY 2021 studies met some quality
standards but the percentage of studies meeting standards varied by activity and by standard.
Methods Summary Finding: DHS evidence-building addressed a balance of formative and
summative aspects, and studies used a wide range of qualitative and quantitative data, data
collection, and analysis methods. The levels in which certain data and methods were used may
limit the Department's ability to make credible inferences and fulfill summative purposes,
especially for quantitative, customer-centric determinations of effectiveness (outcomes and
impacts), cost-effectiveness, or equity that result from DHS mission delivery.
Independence Summary Finding: Most FY 2021 studies were performed by internal staff.
Information provided for studies suggests that the majority of evidence-building activities were
conducted free from inappropriate influence.
Effectiveness Summary Finding: While DHS lacked policies that outlined requirements for
stakeholder engagement and dissemination, some Department-wide and Component
mechanisms existed to gather stakeholder needs, input, and feedback for evidence building, to
disseminate findings of evidence building, and to use evidence for decision making and
improvement. Some organizational contexts, including Component culture, practices, and
technology resources, exist that support evidence building and its use in day-to-day operations.

U.S. Department of Homeland Security
FY 2021 Capacity Assessment
Opportunities for Improvement
The findings suggest the following areas for improvement.
Establish a strong foundation for evidence building and use. DHS capacity building efforts should
continue to (1) foster shared understanding of evidence-building through common terminology
and concepts consistent with the Evidence Act and OMB guidance to which DHS is accountable;
(2) deepen Component-level understanding of personnel, funding, and other infrastructure
available for evidence-building as well as evidence-building activities that are underway within
the Department; and (3) promote the importance of evidence building and use.
Assess the Department's evidence needs and align evidence-building efforts and resources
with those needs. Beyond the DHS learning agenda, developing Component-specific learning
agendas and evaluation plans would enable DHS to comprehensively assess Components' short
and long-term evidence needs, measure Component capacity against those needs, and
appropriately allocate resources to build evidence while targeting gaps in capacity.
Build and sustain evidence building capabilities at the Component level and DHS-wide. To
ensure that evidence building adheres to principles of scientific integrity and rigor, DHS needs to
hire personnel with specialized expertise for evidence building, provide training and time to
develop staff, and establish sufficient budgets to support evidence building activities and procure
external researchers for evidence building. DHS should empower certain evidence-building staff
(or external researchers they manage) with sufficient independence and autonomy to design,
conduct, and appropriately disseminate findings, methods, and data from evidence building.
Aim for continuous improvement of the evidence-building enterprise. DHS should implement
and monitor compliance with existing plans and policies for evidence building and use, and
establish new plans, policies, and mechanisms where needed. Department-wide, evidence
building teams should make plans to improve their efforts, targeting areas identified for
improvement in this assessment.
Promote the dissemination and use of evidence. DHS should consult evidence users and a broad
range of stakeholders to inform evidence-building policies, plans, and activities so they are
relevant and useful. Existing continuous improvement processes should leverage all types of
evidence. DHS and Components should establish new or formalize existing practices to promote
more consistent use of evidence in programs, policymaking, and business processes. Improving
existing dissemination mechanisms to enable timely release of products and findings to the
broadest audiences possible, including publicly releasing evidence, is a necessary precursor for
ensuring its use in learning, improvement, and accountability to the American public.
How Findings Will Be Used
The assessment team and PA&E disseminated findings to, and obtained feedback from,
Components and used findings as the basis of facilitated Component-specific capacity planning
activities. The assessment provided opportunity for a collective and concerted effort to improve
Component and DHS capacity to use and produce evidence, and for building on the foundation
the assessment team has documented in the DHS FY 2021 Capacity Assessment.

U.S. Department of Homeland Security
FY 2021 Capacity Assessment
Overview
Introduction
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has a diverse and complex mission to prevent
attacks and mitigate threats against the United States and our allies, respond to natural and man-
made disasters, and advance American prosperity and economic security. Since DHS was
established from its predecessor agencies in 2003, the Department has continued to expand and
mature capabilities to use data and analysis in shaping strategy and operations.
DHS developed this DHS FY 2021 Capacity Assessment to discover, describe, and assess the
Department's evidence-building, determining where current evidence capacity is and is not
sufficient to meet current and future needs and where capacity building efforts should be
targeted. The capacity assessment supports the Department's implementation of the
Foundations for Evidence Based Policymaking Act of 2018Â³ (Evidence Act) by providing a baseline
understanding of Department's capacity to build and use evidence. This baseline can guide
decisions and next steps for maturing capacity.
The DHS Evaluation Officer, in PA&E, oversees the periodic assessments of DHS capacity to build
and use evidence, with the aim of helping the Department identify concrete steps for continuous
improvement. For the FY 2021 assessment, PA&E developed technical requirements for a task
order awarded to Homeland Security Operations Analysis Center (HSOAC, herein assessment team)
to design and conduct this assessment.
Guiding Principles of Design
The DHS FY 2021 Capacity Assessment fulfills the specific requirement to assess the coverage,
quality, methods, effectiveness, and independence of the Department's evaluation, research,
analysis, and statistics efforts. The assessment team worked closely with PA&E to design an
assessment that would allow the Department to understand the maturity of its evidence-building
enterprise and lay a foundation for strengthening these capabilities over time, while balancing
complex statutory requirements, diverse missions and capabilities across the Components, and
utility. The assessment team used the following principles to guide the design of the assessment
activities:
Support unity of effort. The assessment team designed assessment activities to expand
awareness of the Evidence Act and develop a shared understanding of evidence-building
activities and their utility and importance across the Department.
Plan for iteration and improvement over time. The assessment focused on Components'
most significant evidence-building activities and a limited set of foundational capabilities
that can feasibly be addressed now to mature evidence building. The assessment
identifies opportunities for improving capacity and future assessments of capacity.

FY 2021 Capacity Assessment
Demonstrate usefulness to the DHS Components. The assessment team collected and
analyzed DHS- and Component-level data, generating findings at DHS and Component
levels, to support DHS- and Component-specific planning activities aimed at maturing
capacity for evidence building and use.
Tailor Evidence Act requirements to DHS context. The assessment team organized and
addressed Evidence Act and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requirements to
(1) allow for systematic assessment, across organizations and time, and generation of
useful and actionable findings; (2) gather information from staff to understand capacity
at organizational, individual, and study levels; and 3) minimize the burden on participating
staff while building capacity to sustain this effort long term.
Evidence Building
Informed by a review of the Evidence Act, all applicable OMB guidance, the interim capacity
assessment conducted by DHS in FY 2020, and other relevant materials, PA&E developed a list of
evaluation, research, analysis, and statistical activities (activity subtypes) that should be included
in or excluded from this assessment. Exhibit 2 lists and describes activity subtypes.

U.S. Department of Homeland Security
FY 2021 Capacity Assessment
Capacity Assessment Approach
Informed by a review of the Evidence Act, OMB guidance, the interim capacity assessment
conducted by DHS in FY 2020, and other relevant materials, the assessment team designed:
a comprehensive set of 49 capabilities (called Component-Level Capabilities, or CLCs herein)
that unpack various elements of each of the Evidence Act and OMB requirements and that
can be flexibly applied across evidence building activities.
a structured maturity scoring system tailored to each CLC that is based on a general maturity
model; and
a multimethod approach (e.g., uses discussion groups, web-based surveys, evidence
document reviews) focused on understanding CLC maturity and triangulating across the most
appropriate data sources to develop a complete picture of the maturity of DHS capacity to
build and use evidence.
Exhibit 3 provides a summary of the process used to establish the capacity assessment plan and
to conduct the FY 2021 Capacity Assessment.

Component-Leve Capabilities
For each of the five statutory dimensions (coverage, quality, methods, independence,
effectiveness), the assessment team developed multiple Component-Level Capabilities (CLCs) to
unpack various elements of the dimension. The FY 2021 Capacity Assessment focused on a subset
of CLCs developed (25 of 49) that could feasibly provide
"...an objective accounting of an agency's capacity (the sufficiency of, e.g., the agency's staffing,
funding, infrastructure, and processes) to carry out the evidence-building activities needed to
meet its agency functions and its capacity to disseminate and use evidence."

Subsequent sections provide short descriptions of the CLCs in relation to the methods used to
gather data about them.
Maturity Model
To guide the systematic rating of these capabilities, the assessment team used a maturity model
approach. Informed by the general capability maturity model shown in Exhibit 4, the assessment
team customized the data analysis method(s) and the maturity scoring rubric for each CLC and
the data collected for it. Generally, for each CLC, the maturity ratings roughly translate in
accordance with the general capability maturity model.

U.S. Department of Homeland Security
FY 2021 Capacity Assessment
To help prepare Component representatives to participate in the capacity assessment, the
assessment team and PA&E developed guidance defining the evidence-building activities,
structured requests to gather sampling information from Components, a list of frequently asked
questions, and materials for webinars. The assessment team and PA&E hosted webinars, office
hours, and monitored a dedicated email alias to provide assistance to capacity assessment
participants before and throughout the data collection period.
The assessment team convened preparatory meetings (pre-meetings) May 3-14, 2021 with
Component representatives to help them identify the most significant evidence-building
activities conducted in the Component, the DHS federal personnel to participate in capacity
assessment data collection activities and evidence building activities (studies) to inventory. For
an activity deemed most significant, the Component would generally be expected to have a
portfolio of evidence products and activities that are conducted on a recurrent basis. The
information gathered following the pre-meetings is summarized below.
All participating Components reported that they conducted analysis. Most Components
conducted evaluation and research. Fewer than half of Components identified statistics as a most
significant activity. The number of participating Components conducting each evidence-building
activity is summarized in Exhibit 5.

FY 2021 Capacity Assessment
Assessment Methods
The assessment team used a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods and multiple data
sources to inform maturity ratings for CLCs. This section describes the focus, timing, and sample
for each of the study methods: group discussions, structured plan review, individual survey,
study inventory survey, and structured study review.
Group Discussions
The capacity assessment draws on group discussions with DHS Headquarters and Component
evidence-building leaders, supplemented with a review of relevant documents collected from
Components by PA&E and the assessment team. The assessment team conducted group
discussions with nine Components and one crosscutting discussion with representatives from
multiple organizations in DHS HQ, between May 24 and June 11, 2021. Additionally, two
Components provided written input instead of joining a group discussion.
The assessment team gathered information using a group discussion protocol and used this
information to develop capability maturity ratings and explanatory rationales for the ratings.
Group discussions and supplementary document review explored the following:
budget for and investment in evidence building;
strategic and evidence plans;
policies and guidance for planning and conducting evidence building;
policies and mechanisms for stakeholder engagement to support evidence building, including
mechanisms to gather evidence users' needs and feedback;
processes to integrate evidence in decision making;
continuous improvement or learning cycle process that use evidence; and
policies and mechanisms for disseminating findings to external stakeholders and the public.
Structured Plan Review
The assessment team assessed the presence and quality of Department and Component-wide
evidence plans, including evidence-building plans (or learning agendas), evaluation plans, and
performance plans, against statutory and OMB requirements for each type of plan.5
The Department was in the process of developing its FY2022-2026 learning agenda and FY2023
annual evaluation plan, but the assessment team identified three relevant DHS-wide documents:

Components had no formal plans in place at the time of this assessment. One Component
strategic plan that contained performance measures with annual targets was reviewed, but the
results are not reported here.
Individual Survey
The assessment team administered a web-based survey to Components' identified evidence-
building staff (EBS). The individual survey was fielded between May 14 and June 1, 2021 to a total
of 483 individuals, including all individuals identified by Components as evidence-building
Leaders or Staff. The survey explored respondents' perspectives of the following:
personal knowledge of core evidence-building competencies, including procurement and
management of external organizations for evidence building;
relevance of core evidence building tasks to their job;
training and other organizational supports for evidence building and use; and
Component context.
Evidence-building staff completed 191 surveys (40 percent of the 483 fielded surveys). Findings
from the survey must be interpreted keeping these limited response rates and the potential for
bias in mind; findings do not generalize beyond the respondents. Exhibit 7 presents the survey
sample total distribution (counts) across evidence-building activities.

Inventory of Studies
The capacity assessment included a survey-based inventory of FY 2021 evaluation, research,
analysis, and statistics studies. The survey was fielded May 20 - June 11, 2021 to federal
personnel identified by Components as managing FY 2021 studies.
11
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
FY 2021 Capacity Assessment
The assessment team used the study inventory survey to collect factual information from study
managers about FY 2021 studies, including but not limited to the following:
evidence building activity and subtype;
DHS strategic objectives and Component missions addressed by the study;
types of study purposes and foci of the evidence building;
types of data sources, data collection methods, and analysis used in evidence building;
types of claims or judgements made;
use of input from and dissemination to stakeholders external to the research team;
protections for the safety and privacy of participants; and
study plans and reports, to allow for the independent structured study review.
The study inventory survey and structured study review rating guides (described below) were
developed based on applicable OMB guidance that outlined the quality standards and best
practices for federal evidence building. 8 The study inventory survey was also designed to collect
data relating to multiple Evidence Act and OMB requirements, including a list of Department
operations and activities evaluated and analyzed (see Appendix C).
The assessment team fielded surveys for 368 studies that Components identified as underway in
FY 2021. Study managers responded to the survey for 244 studies (66 percent). This total included
86 total surveys where the respondent indicated that a study was not conducting in-scope
evidence-building activities (34 surveys) or was conducting performance measurement (52
analysis surveys); in these instances, the survey concluded without collecting more information.
Respondents completed surveys for 158 studies (43 percent of the 368 studies). Findings from
the survey must be interpreted keeping these limited response rates and the potential for bias in
mind; findings do not generalize beyond the reported studies. Exhibit 10 summarizes the total
number of surveys fielded and completed surveys received across DHS as a whole, as well as by
evidence-building activity.

Structured Study Review
The assessment team planned to draw a sample of FY 2021 evaluation, research, analysis, and
statistics activities to independently rate the quality and independence of submitted study plans
or reports using the study inventory survey questions and study review rating guides. Only four
of the 51 documents submitted by respondents contained information that was sufficient for the
assessment team to conduct an independent review. Although the independent review could not
be completed as planned, the assessment team was able to analyze self-reported survey
responses to arrive at maturity ratings for seven CLCs. Exhibit 11 summarizes the criteria used for
rating study quality and independence.
Exhibit 11. Criteria Used for Rating Study Quality and Independence
Quality and Independence Criteria
Evaluation and Research
Rigor: Did the evaluation or research (1) make claims that do not go beyond the data; (2) use data collection
methods that specifically cover content that has direct bearing on the question being addressed; (3) acknowledge
relevant limitations; and (4) attempt to mitigate at least some of the limitations
Relevance and utility: Extent of connection between the evaluation or research and the missions of the Component
Transparency: How findings and methods are being disseminated (or planned to be disseminated)
Independence and objectivity: Extent to which the evaluation or research team did not modify the study based on
input from individuals outside of the research team in which there was conflict of interest present
Ethics: Extent to which the evaluation or research team protects the safety and privacy of the participants and other
affected entities
Improvements: Whether the evaluation or research team is looking to improve its work going forward
Analysis
Statement of need: Whether the analysis has a statement of need specifying a problem to be solved
Monitors goals: Whether the analysis facilitates a judgment about whether the goals of the activity were met
Examines costs and benefits: Whether the analysis makes judgments about the advantages and disadvantages of
the activity being analyzed
Examines alternative approaches: Whether the analysis considers other possible approaches besides the activity
being assessed
Utility: How findings and methods are being disseminated (or planned to be disseminated)
Improvements: Whether the analysis team is looking to improve its analysis going forward
Statistics
Relevance to policy: Extent to which input is collected on statistical methods and outputs from data users and
experts
Credibility among data users: Extent to which statistical information is disseminated through multiple channels, in
various forms that are appropriate to lay persons and experts, reflects limitations, and is made available in a way that
maintains confidentiality
Trust among data providers: Extent to which data are protected, such that they are analyzed under a pledge of
confidentiality and cannot be used for administrative, regulatory, law enforcement, or any other nonstatistical purpose
Independence from political and other undue external influence: Extent to which statistical personnel are authorized
to refuse to disseminate identifiable data, choose when to release data and how; and choose how to maintain and
store data
Improvements: Whether the statistical team is looking to improve its data and statistics going forward

Maturity Ratings and Synthesis of Findings
The assessment team applied the CLC-specific maturity scoring rubric and analysis methods to
the data collected for each CLC to produce a maturity rating for the CLC by evidence-building
activity and/or crosscutting (across all rated evidence-building activities). For CLC ratings based
on information gathered during discussion groups, the assessment team generated preliminary
maturity ratings and an accompanying explanatory rationale for each rating. Components
reviewed and could provide additional documentation to inform the assessment team's review
and, potentially, adjustments to the preliminary ratings.
Components were provided an opportunity to review and provide feedback on their draft
Component profile. Once Component profiles were finalized, the assessment team synthesized
findings across Components to document baseline capacities within each of the assessment
dimensions for DHS as a whole.
The assessment team produced a comprehensive two-volume report containing their detailed
analysis, findings, and recommendations from which this public summary report, a set of internal
Component profiles, and DHS- and Component-level briefing materials were drawn. From
November 2021 to February 2022 the assessment team conducted twelve briefings on assessment
findings with DHS HQ and Component representatives. Participation in a DHS-wide briefing and
eleven Component briefings, delivered in the context of their capacity planning activities, was
coordinated by Components. These reports and briefings provided the information needed to
initiate informed discussions with Component leaders about a desired future state that is most
appropriate for each Component's mission, operations, resources, and needs, and the appropriate
milestones to achieve that future state from the baseline capacity documented in this assessment.
15
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
FY 2021 Capacity Assessment
Challenges and Limitations
The assessment team's use of qualitative and quantitative methods and multiple data sources
were complementary, and while incomplete, converged toward common findings. Several
limitations should be considered when reviewing the findings.
Complexity. The dimensions, evidence-building activities, and CLCs assessed were complex
and overlapping, requiring understanding and judgements around the terms, definitions, and
uses that were difficult even for technical experts. Variation of evidence-building capabilities
and organizational characteristics (for example, mission, structure, and philosophy on
centralization) between and within Components contributed additional complexity.
Complexity added to the overall challenge of fostering unity in how evidence-building and
maturity are defined across the four broad activities and how to assess and continuously
improve capacity for evidence.
Sampling and response. The data reflect perspectives and factual information provided by
DHS federal personnel who contribute to Components' most significant, in-scope evidence-
building activities.9 The resulting findings were determined to a great extent by whether
personnel whose input was vital to the capacity assessment were prepared and able to
participate in the assessment, not just as informed respondents but as collaborators on
sampling. Despite efforts to prepare, support, and provide alternatives to optimize
participation, issues persisted through the data-gathering and analysis phases that led to
sampling and response limitations. Findings from the survey must be interpreted keeping
limited response rates and the potential for bias in mind.
Operations research as an analysis activity. The inclusion of operations research as an
analysis activity, given there is no existing federal or DHS guidance for operations research,
introduced limitations in the analysis findings and how they should be interpreted.
Specifically, inclusion of operations research may have had the effect of lowering some
analysis maturity ratings, because many of the CLCs tied to guidance or standards.
Objectivity of Quality and Independence dimension measures. The assessment team could
not complete an independent review of studies due to the insufficient documentation (study
plans and reports) provided by respondents in connection to FY 2021 studies. Instead, they
used information reported by respondents in the study inventory survey to assess studies'
quality and independence and to establish respective maturity ratings. Although respondents
had access to significantly more information related to the quality and independence of each
effort, these data may also be similarly affected by issues related to complexity, sampling,
and response or other bias.
9 The assessment intentionally did not seek perspectives of a broader group of DHS federal personnel as users of
evidence. The Government Accountability Office's 2020 Survey of Federal Managers summary of DHS managers'
responses provides this additional perspective. See 2020 Federal Managers Survey: Results on Government
Performance Management issues, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) (GAO, 2021)

Findings
A high-level snapshot, or scorecard, of maturity across DHS evidence-building activities and
statutory dimensions is shown in Exhibit 13. The remainder of the section presents an overview
of CLC maturity ratings and findings, organized by the five assessment dimensions (i.e., coverage,
quality, methods, effectiveness, independence).
Maturity of DHS Evidence Building Activities
Conducting the capacity assessment provided an opportunity to discover, describe, and assess
the Department's evidence-building, determining where current evidence capacity is and may
not be sufficient to meet current and future needs and where capacity building efforts should be
targeted.
Overall DHS lacked shared understanding - common terminology and concepts - related to
evidence-building as defined by the Evidence Act and OMB. Most Components did not have
coordinated Component-level perspective on staff, funding, and other infrastructure for
evidence building or for evidence-building activities (studies) underway in fiscal year (FY) 2021.
Despite this, the assessment team determined that all four evidence building activities (i.e.,
evaluation, research, analysis, and statistics) were underway across the Department with varying
levels of maturity on the assessment dimensions of coverage, quality, methods, independence,
and effectiveness, as summarized in Exhibit 13. DHS capacity for evidence-building and use was
uneven across Components, nascent in some places, but developing. Given the participants were
restricted to individuals for which evidence building was relevant, these findings suggested
opportunities to improve in the future.

Overview of Coverage Findings
DHS received a range of maturity scores between '1' (not initiated) and '3' (implementing) across
the Coverage CLCs. Exhibit 14 presents DHS maturity ratings for these CLCs by evidence-building
activity (per CLC and overall) and crosscutting (across all evidence-building activities). Coverage
CLCs (average) ratings reflect the average maturity ratings (scores) for the rated activity specific
CLCs.
The assessment team did not assign a CLC maturity rating for the inventory CLC; instead, they
provided DHS a structured inventory of FY 2021 studies and also summarized study
characteristics in dimension-specific findings sections. Appendix C includes a list of selected
evaluation, research, analysis, and statistics studies from the assessment team's inventory of FY
2021 studies that were or expect to be disseminated to the public. PA&E supplemented the list
with studies from the Department's annual evaluation plans (FY 2022 and FY 2023) and the
unified regulatory agendas (FY 2021 and FY 2022) that were not included in the inventory of the
FY 2021 studies. To ensure the list was useful as an inventory of studies, PA&E also incorporated
studies identified through a search of DHS, Component, and DHS-sponsored entities' websites.

Coverage Summary Finding: DHS had some staff, funding, and policies in place, and evidence-
building (studies) underway in FY 2021, but they were distributed unevenly across the
Department and considered by many Component representatives to be insufficient to fully
achieve all the objectives defined in the Evidence Act.
DHS had staff with primary responsibilities for evidence building, but the size of the
evidence-building staff varied across Components and activities. Components identified 483
individuals who support Components' most significant evidence-building as a primary
function of their job. Personnel were distributed unevenly, from eight in one Component to
128 in another. Component-level survey response rates varied from 16 percent to 77 percent.
Respondents reported some knowledge of core evidence-building competencies though
they deemed many competencies only somewhat relevant to their jobs. The percentages
of respondents that self-reported higher levels (rating of '4' or (5') of knowledge and
relevance to their job varied widely (33-83 percent for knowledge and 20-84 percent for
relevance). For 16 of the 20, core evidence-building competencies assessed, fewer than 70
percent of respondents reported higher levels of knowledge and relevance. For nine
competencies, fewer than 50 percent of respondents considered them relevant to their jobs.
Exhibit 15 summarizes a subset of the assessed competencies, including those with the six
highest and six lowest percentages of respondents reporting higher levels of both knowledge
and relevance to their job. Appendix D provides the full set of items and responses.

Respondents received some of the necessary supports to conduct evidence-building
activities. Fewer than 70 percent of respondents agreed or strongly agreed they had support
for evidence building, including training to find, gather and assess data (60 percent); access
to support staff (59 percent); and time to conduct evidence building activities (55 percent) or
participate in a professional learning community (45 percent). Exhibit 17 (next page)
summarizes responses to support for evidence building. Appendix D provides the full set of
items and responses used in Exhibits 16 and 17.
DHS may not have enough dedicated staff, or enough staff and contractors with specialized
expertise, to effectively conduct evidence-building activities. One hundred fifty-eight (158)
respondents described what resources they need to effectively conduct evidence building
activities. Of those, many respondents reported the need for more staff (44 percent), and
specifically, more professional staff, contractors, and subject matter experts with specialized
expertise in evidence building. Respondents also reported needing training for existing staff
(24 percent), access to data and tools for analysis (22 percent), collaboration (15 percent),
time to conduct evidence-building activities (14 percent), and funding (11 percent). Twelve
percent of respondents indicated no resources were needed. Exhibit 18 (next page)
summarizes responses to what resources are needed.

The size of budgets to support evidence building varied by Components and by activity and
many Component representatives reported their budgets were insufficient to meet all the
Evidence Act objectives. One Component reported a Component-wide funding structure for
evidence-building with funds both budgeted and invested for evaluation, research, and
analysis activities. Some Components had substantial funding for one or more evidence-
building activities, often statistics. Representatives of six Components reported in discussion
groups that they had insufficient funds to support evidence-building activities. They noted
that as a result, the Component could not fully achieve all the objectives defined in the
Evidence Act.
22
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
FY 2021 Capacity Assessment
DHS-wide policies provided relevant information to plan and conduct evidence-building
activities, but Components did not have equivalent policies and guidance for various
evidence-building activities. DHS-wide policies and guidance for evaluation and some
analysis activities (e.g., regulatory analysis, and performance measurement) provided
relevant information on how to plan and conduct those evidence-building activities. Six
Components reported they did not have any policies or guidance in place specifying how to
plan and conduct any evidence-building activity. Five Components had policies or guidance
in place for at least one activity. While some Components were in the process of developing
such policies and guidance, others highlighted challenges, including culture, associated with
creating additional, centralized guidance to inform evidence-building at the Component level.
DHS had a portfolio of evidence-building and the size of the evidence-building portfolio
varied across activities and Components. Components identified 368 studies underway in FY
2021. Studies were distributed unevenly, from zero studies in one Component to 74 in
another. Component-level survey response rates for the study inventory varied from eight
percent to 71 percent, excluding the 86 surveys where the respondent indicated no in-scope
evidence building activities or performance measurement.
Trends in the characteristics of FY 2021 studies suggested other areas in which DHS
coverage may not be sufficient to meet key objectives of the Evidence Act.
- DHS evidence-building activities should support the Department's strategic plan, address
all divisions' needs, and consider equity, a key Administration priority. Evaluation and
research studies supported the full range of DHS strategic objectives (data not shown),
with the largest percentages of studies aligned to "responding during incidents" (27
percent); "secure and manage air, land, and maritime borders" (26 percent) and
"maintain U.S. waterways and maritime resources" (24 percent). Studies were submitted
by more than 70 DHS divisions. Most evaluation and research studies (86 percent) directly
related to Component missions. Very few studies (13 percent) addressed equity issues.
- DHS should meaningfully engage and collaborate with external stakeholders (such as
public, state, and local agencies, and non-governmental researchers) throughout the
evidence lifecycle. Yet only one in four reported studies (26 percent) was conducted by
external organizations and about one in three (31 percent) reported studies disseminated
information to the public. The Independence and Effectiveness sections report these data
in greater detail.
- DHS should use evidence to improve programs, policies, regulations, strategies, and
operations. Greater percentages of studies focused on operations (35 percent), programs
(29 percent), and activities (19 percent) compared to policies (eight percent), strategies
(two percent), and regulations (one percent).
These study characteristics are summarized in Exhibit 19.

Maturity ratings for the first CLC (policy outlines quality standards) represent an average of DHS
Components' maturity scores for the evidence-building activities and crosscutting scores. 'Not
rated' and gray shading indicate that a CLC was assessed only on an activity-specific or
crosscutting basis. Quality CLCs (average) ratings reflected the average maturity scores for the
rated activity specific CLCs, adjusted to account for additional information provided by DHS HQ
as appropriate.

U.S. Department of Homeland Security
FY 2021 Capacity Assessment
Quality Summary Finding: DHS-wide policies and guidance outlined quality standards for some
activities, though compliance with these standards varied across evidence-building activities.
Department-level evidence plans were relatively mature. Components did not have equivalent
policies and plans for their evidence-building activities. FY 2021 studies met some quality
standards but the percentage of studies meeting standards varied by activity and by standard.
DHS-wide policies and guidance specified quality standards for some activities, but
Components did not have equivalent policies and guidance. DHS had department-wide
policies and guidance for evaluation and certain analysis activities (i.e., regulatory analysis
and performance measurement) that provided relevant guidance on quality standards. The
Department also had broad directives for scientific integrity and quality of scientific,
statistical, and financial information and was developing policies to improve the quality of
certain statistical activities. No DHS Component reported a Component-wide policy that
outlined quality standards for any evidence-building activity at the time of the assessment,
though five Components were in the process of developing such policies.
DHS monitored compliance with quality standards for certain activities. Across the
Department, representatives reported that robust processes were in place to facilitate quality
and consistency in planning and building evidence for two analysis activities (i.e., regulatory
analysis and performance measurement.) These processes included internal and external
review of evidence-building against established quality standards and federal best practices.
The assessment team could not confirm the extent to which DHS-wide evaluation, research,
and information quality standards were implemented and monitored for compliance in
Components.
Department-level evidence plans were relatively mature, but Components did not have
equivalent plans. Department-wide evidence-building plans met the majority of assessment
criteria (data not shown). The interim learning agenda (LA) and evaluation plan (EP) provided
clear, concrete, and actionable guidance for developing and using evidence to inform DHS
activities and consultation with internal stakeholders, but lacked consultation with external
stakeholders. 10 The annual performance report included target and actual performance
measures from FY 2016 to present and planned targets for FY 2021 and FY 2022 but was not
sufficiently aligned with the strategic plan. DHS Components had no formal evidence plans in
place at the time of this assessment,11 which limits the Department's ability to assess current
capacity against evidence needs and appropriately allocate resources to address needs and
capacity gaps.
10
Consultation with external stakeholders occurred during the course of this capacity assessment for development
of the Department's FY2022-2026 learning agenda, but information about these efforts were not available to the
assessment team.
11 The assessment team reviewed a Component strategic plan that included annual performance targets. The
results of the plan's review are not provided in this report.

U.S. Department of Homeland Security
FY 2021 Capacity Assessment
Study inventory data suggested reported FY 2021 studies met some quality standards, but
the percentage of studies meeting standards varied by activity and by standard. Study
contacts' responses to questions related to quality (six multi-part questions for each of
evaluation, research, and analysis, and five for statistics) suggested higher percentages of
evaluation and research studies met quality standards than did analysis and statistical
studies. The percentage of studies meeting quality standards are summarized in Exhibit 21.
Strengths and weaknesses are also described in the three findings that follow.

U.S. Department of Homeland Security
FY 2021 Capacity Assessment
Most reported FY 2021 evaluation and research studies met standards for relevance and
utility, independence and objectivity, and ethics; however, fewer studies met standards for
rigor and transparency. The percentage of evaluation and research studies that met
relevance and utility, independence and objectivity, and ethics standards ranged from 76
percent to 98 percent. The comparatively low percentages for transparency (about 30
percent for both evaluation and research) indicated that study findings, methods, and data
(either in full or summary form) were not routinely released to the public or other key
stakeholders. The low percentages for rigor (about 40 percent for both evaluation and
research) indicated that studies did not attempt to mitigate at least some identified
limitations (for research) or made claims that go beyond the data (for evaluation).
Majority of reported FY 2021 analysis studies, which were predominantly operations
research, 12 did not meet criteria for quality. Respondents self-reported that fewer than half
of the 40 analysis studies examined costs and benefits, examined alternative approaches,
assessed whether goals were met, and had utility. 13 Analysis studies scored lowest on criteria
related to utility, indicating that DHS did not regularly release findings and methods, including
deidentified analysis data, so that laypeople and experts can understand the analysis.
Majority of reported FY 2021 statistical studiesÂ¹ did not meet criteria for quality. Of the
four criteria used to determine the quality of statistics, relevance to policy and trust among
data providers received the lowest scores. Of the three elements examined for relevance to
policy, the most common weakness was collecting input on statistical methods and outputs
from both data users and experts. Of the two elements assessed for building trust among
data providers, the most common weakness was analyzing data under a pledge of
confidentiality. Respondents for 70 percent of the reported statistics products indicated
teams were looking to improve their data and statistics in the future. This suggests that many
DHS evidence-building staff who conduct statistics recognize the need to improve on their
work and address gaps.
12 The study inventory survey was not completed for performance measurement activities and few policy or
regulatory analysis studies were reported; thus, the quality of studies reflected primarily operations research.
13 OMB guidance for analysis activities consistently referenced 'utility' as a criterion of quality, described as data's
utility for intended users and for its intended purpose, including downstream use and reproducibility.
14 DHS does not have any designated statistical agencies or activities that are required to comply with the
Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act of 2018 (CIPSEA).

inventory, as reported by 158 study inventory survey
responses across 14 Components, and findings. The responses and documents provided by
respondents were not sufficient to examine the appropriateness of the methods to specific
Component divisions, or to questions, purposes, or claims made for a specific study. However,
this section illustrates, with evaluation, how summary information about study purposes, claims,
and methods can still be useful in considering appropriateness of methods for an evidence-
building activity.
Two important concepts in this section are study purpose and study claims. A formative purpose
is one that informs or improves the design or implementation of an activity. A summative
purpose is one that determines what goals, outcomes, or impacts have been achieved as a result
of implementing an activity. Some studies only describe people, events, or incidents. Other
studies make claims such as inferences, such attempting to show a relationship between
activities and measurable outcomes. Studies may make other claims, often derived from the
inferences made. The credibility of inferences is dependent on the specific data, methods, and
study designs used to address the questions.
15
Overview of Methods Findings
Methods Summary Finding: DHS evidence-building addressed a balance of formative and
summative aspects, and studies used a wide range of qualitative and quantitative data, data
collection, and analysis methods. The frequencies with which certain data sources and methods
were used may limit the Department's ability to make credible inferences and fulfill summative
purposes, especially for quantifying effectiveness (outcomes and impacts), cost-effectiveness, or
equity that relates to or results from DHS mission delivery.
15 OMB guidance indicates that questions of effectiveness or efficiency should be answered by evaluation and
claims of effectiveness and impact must be supported by study designs that can credibly generate causal evidence
when well executed. Impact evaluations include experimental (i.e., randomized control trials) and quasi-
experimental designs and may necessitate direct data collection and long-term or multi-year participant follow-up.

Study purposes varied by evidence-building activity but were balanced in addressing
formative and summative purposes overall. The percentage of studies that addressed some
summative purposes varied across research (62 percent), evaluation (75 percent), analysis
(80 percent), and statistics (93 percent). Overall, they were balanced in addressing formative
and summative purposes: 75 percent of studies had some summative aspects and 77 percent

Studies used a variety of methods to collect data directly from individuals, and many used
qualitative methods only or mixed qualitative and quantitative methods of data collection.
Across reported evaluation, research, and analysis studies, 34 percent used qualitative data
collection methods, such as interviews or focus groups, observations, and questionnaires.
Twenty-nine percent of studies combined qualitative methods with other quantitative
methods, such as surveys (of a census, statistical sample, or non-statistical sample) and tests
of cognition, attitudes, or skills. Fewer studies (19 percent) relied on quantitative methods
only and 18 percent did not collect data directly. Exhibit 25 reports the most common data

Most FY 2021 studies collected data directly from individuals within DHS Components,
while fewer studies collected data from DHS customers and external partners. Nearly 80
percent of reported evaluation, research, and analysis studies collected information directly
from individuals within DHS. Comparatively fewer collected data directly from external
stakeholders, such as individuals of other federal agencies, program customers, non-
government researchers, or state, local, tribal, or territorial (SLTT) agencies. Exhibit 26 reports

Quantitative analysis, in particular descriptive statistics, was common across DHS evidence
building. Fewer evaluation, research, and statistics studies used advanced quantitative
analysis methods compared to analysis studies. Nearly 80 percent of reported evaluation,
research, and analysis studies used quantitative analysis to support evidence building.
Compared with analysis studies, lower percentages of evaluation, research, and statistics
studies reported using advanced methods such as system modeling, inferential statistics,
time series modeling, and economic analysis. Exhibits 29 and 30 report common quantitative
analysis methods by evidence-building activity.
17 OMB expects agencies to draw on a full range of methodological approaches, including qualitative research,
ethnography, and other inclusive methodologies such as participatory, emancipatory, and community-based
research that are informed by social and behavioral sciences. Such methodologies use many of the advanced
analysis methods. See Evidence-Based Policymaking: Learning Agendas and Annual Evaluation Plans, M-21-27

U.S. Department of Homeland Security
FY 2021 Capacity Assessment
The low percentages with which certain data and methods were used in evaluations may
limit the Department's ability to make credible inferences and fulfill summative purposes
at the levels reported, including quantifying effectiveness (outcomes and impacts), cost-
effectiveness, or equity that relates to or results from DHS mission delivery.
- Most reported evaluation studies were focused on programs (68 percent), had some
summative purposes (75 percent), and attempted to make an inference (64 percent). This
means most reported evaluations aimed to determine what goals, outcomes, or impacts
were achieved as a result of implementing a program and attempted to show
relationships between program activities and measurable outcomes.
-
Low percentages of reported evaluations collected data directly from program customers
or beneficiaries (26 percent) and other external stakeholders (18 percent SLTT agency, 15
percent each for federal agency and grant recipients), as compared with personnel from
DHS Components. Direct data collection from customers and external stakeholders
provides evaluation-specific data that is not available in administrative data, such as
experiences, barriers, unmet needs, outcomes, and adverse consequences of interacting
with DHS programs, to inform customer- and results-centric design and delivery.
- Low percentages of reported evaluations used advanced qualitative data analysis, such
as thematic analysis (15 percent), grounded theory, interpretative phenomenology, and
ethnography (all 0 percent, data not shown), despite 74 percent conducting some form
of qualitative analysis. Such methods enhance the rigor of interpretations of qualitative
data in relation to the theoretical frameworks guiding program designs (such as logic or
system models) and in relation to customers' lived experiences with and without the
program or the sociocultural contexts in which they receive program services.
- Although half of reported evaluations conducted some form of quantitative data
collection, low percentages of evaluations used advanced quantitative analysis methods,
such as inferential statistics (15 percent), time series modeling (12 percent), and
economic analysis (12 percent). These methods, combined with certain study designs,
enable determinations under what circumstances a sample of individuals represents the
broader program population or society; if and how much differences between two or
more groups, changes over time, or associations between variables can be attributed to
(or considered caused by) an implemented program when compared to its absence or
alternative programs; and whether it is the most cost-effective alternative.
Federal evaluation standards indicate evaluations should use the most advanced methods and
study designs appropriate to address evaluation questions, while balancing goals, scale, timeline,
feasibility, and available resources, to provide greater confidence in the results. Since the
Evidence Act Title 1 elevates evaluation as an essential mission function, the issues related to the
rigor and appropriateness of data and methods used in evaluation studies are important for
future capacity building and assessment activities.

internal staff who operate with an appropriate level of independence from program,
regulatory, and policymaking activities, 18 so these findings are reported for context only.
Overview of Independence Findings
Independence Summary Finding: Most FY 2021 studies were performed by internal staff.
Information provided for studies suggests that the majority of evidence-building activities were
conducted free from inappropriate influence.
DHS received two maturity ratings of '4' (completed) and one maturity rating of
'3' (implementing) across the CLCs. DHS scores for three CLCs, each of which represents only
one evidence-building activity, appear in Exhibit 32. The 'Not rated' and gray shading indicates
that a CLC was assessed only on an activity-specific basis from an average of all respondents'
data who reported their study was conducting the given activity, so there are no crosscutting
ratings.

FY 2021 Capacity Assessment
About one in four reported studies were conducted by researchers independent from DHS.
The majority of reported studies (74 percent) were conducted by internal staff in the
Component or in another DHS Component and 26 percent by independent researchers, or an
external firm, organization, or group. Exhibit 33 summarizes the percentage of studies
reporting who is conducting the study, whether internal or external researchers.

Study inventory data suggested the majority of FY 2021 studies were conducted
independently and objectively, free from inappropriate influence, and the study teams
were looking to improve the independence and objectivity of evidence-building studies
moving forward. The extent to which evidence-building activities were conducted free from
inappropriate influence varied by activity type, with greater percentages of evaluation and
research reporting indicators of independence. Summarized previously in Exhibit 21, the
assessment team reported the following:
- A majority reported evaluation (76 percent) and research (93 percent) did not modify the
study based on input from individuals outside of the research team, or made
modifications based on input from individuals with no conflicts of interest.
-
Only 40 percent of statistical studies indicated at least two of the three criteria for
independence of the study team: authorized to refuse to disseminate identifiable data;
choose when to release data and how; and choose how to maintain and store data.
Respondents who reported modifying the design or results of studies (typically, evaluations)
based on outside input reported having done so to coordinate findings among other agencies
and stakeholders, to promote inclusivity and collaboration, or to solicit the feedback of subject-
matter experts to improve the rigor of the work. Such rationale are consistent with federal
standards for evaluation.

established to disseminate evidence products to internal and external stakeholders, including the
public. This section presents findings from the discussion groups and accompanying document
review.
Although the assessment team checked whether the study findings were made available and to
whom, these data were not used in the maturity rating and are reported for context only.
Finally, the individual survey gathered respondents' perceptions of their Component context.
Component context, including Component culture, practices, and technology resources, can
affect capacity to effectively use evidence. These data were not used for any CLC maturity ratings
in the FY 2021 capacity assessment; however, these data may provide an important baseline
measure of the extent to which supportive organizational context exists for evidence use in day-
to-day operations.
Overview of Effectiveness Findings
Effectiveness Summary Finding: While DHS lacked policies that outlined requirements for
stakeholder engagement and dissemination, some Department-wide and Component
mechanisms existed to gather stakeholder needs, input, and feedback for evidence building, to
disseminate findings of evidence building, and to use evidence for decision making and
improvement. Some organizational contexts, including Component culture, practices, and
technology resources, exist that support evidence building and use in day-to-day operations.

DHS received a range of maturity scores between '1' (not initiated) and '3' (implementing)
across the Effectiveness CLCs. Analysis was more mature than other activities across most
CLCs. Ratings for the seven CLCs, by evidence-building activity (per CLC and overall) and
crosscutting (across all evidence-building activities), appear in Exhibit 34. Effectiveness CLCs

Overall, DHS lacked policies or procedures that outlined requirements for engaging a broad
array of individual and external stakeholders in evidence building activities. DHS
implemented and monitored compliance with Department-wide guidance for regulatory
analysis (one of multiple analysis subtypes) stakeholder engagement and reporting. While
the Department-wide instruction for evaluation also provided guidance relating to
stakeholder engagement, compliance was not yet monitored across the Department. No
Component-wide policies or procedures were in place that outlined requirements for
stakeholder engagement plans and reporting in evidence-building.
41
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
FY 2021 Capacity Assessment
DHS has implemented some mechanisms to assess evidence user needs, but these
mechanisms were not used consistently to plan evidence-building activities or to inform
programs, policies, regulations, or organizations. Nine Components reported some
mechanisms were in place to assess evidence users' or consumers' needs and seek input and
feedback from users or consumers (or both) for at least one type of evidence-building activity;
however, these mechanisms were used irregularly to plan evidence-building activities or to
inform programs, policies, regulations, and organizations. Of the nine Components that
reported having some mechanisms in place to assess evidence consumers' needs, eight had
mechanisms pertaining to analysis and four Components had mechanisms in place specifically
related to one or more of their evaluation, research, and statistics activities.
Leaders and staff across the Department somewhat consistently used evidence in business
processes, program activities, and organizational decision making, with strengths in the use
of regulatory analysis and performance measurement information. Seven Components
provided information that informed a maturity score of 3 (Implementing) or higher. Other
Components noted that products derived from evidence-building activities were occasionally
used to inform ongoing processes, program activities, and organizational policies, practices,
and decision making but that the use of such data was inconsistent. In some of these cases,
the process for integrating evidence into their activities was in a "nascent stage."
Components reported having a more robust process for integrating some evidence but not
for all four activities. According to Component representatives who participated in discussion
groups, evidence from analysis and statistics was used more regularly than other evidence
types.
DHS established performance measurement processes that serve as continuous
improvement or learning cycle processes; although, most Components had not
implemented their own continuous improvement processes to focus on Component-
specific improvements. DHS reported well-established strategic review process through
which the Department synthesized available evidence to assess program progress in
achieving DHS's priority goals. The strategic review process used performance measurement
information; however, the assessment team could not determine whether and how other
types of evidence, including DHS-sponsored evaluation, research, statistics, or other forms of
analysis, informed the strategic review process. Operational and some support Components
participated in these efforts, but some support Components did not participate. Most
Components did not have equivalent formal continuous learning processes to identify
promising practices, problem areas, causal factors, or areas for improvement specific to their
missions. However, several Components reported informal processes or activities used for
other purposes that also helped to support this objective.
42
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
FY 2021 Capacity Assessment
DHS had Department-wide policies and guidance that outline requirements and authorities
for dissemination of regulatory analysis and performance measurement products, as well
as some policy and guidance in place for evaluation and research for which compliance was
not monitored. Components generally did not have equivalent policies. DHS had
department-wide policies and guidance for research (scientific integrity), evaluation, and
certain analysis activities (e.g., regulatory analysis and performance measurement), certain
aspects of which are relevant to dissemination. Components were required to adhere to
these policies and either participate in or feed equivalent activities into HQ-coordinated
activities. No DHS Component reported having in place Component-wide policies or
procedures that outlined requirements and authorities for evidence dissemination plans.
However, two Components reported that they were in the process of developing such policies
and procedures for one or more evidence-building activities.
DHS had some mechanisms in place to disseminate evidence products and findings to
internal and external stakeholders, but mechanisms were not in place across all
Components for all evidence-building activities. DHS representatives consistently reported
that DHS follows all applicable statutory and federal guidance pertaining to regulatory
analysis, which requires certain regulatory analyses, including methods, findings, and data,
be disseminated to the public so that interested parties can replicate analyses. Similarly, DHS
followed federal guidance relating to performance measurement, annually publishing
performance and accountability reports, including the DHS annual financial report, annual
performance report, and the DHS summary of performance and financial information on
DHS's public website. All Components participating in discussion groups reported either that
they had some mechanisms in place for at least one activity or that they were in the process
of developing such mechanisms for at least one activity. Components provided examples of
internal and external mechanisms for dissemination, including issuing information on internal
and public websites, blogs, social media, white papers, and dashboards.
Although DHS had some mechanisms in place to publicly release completed products from
certain evidence-building activities, mechanisms were not in place across all Components
and for all types of evidence-building activities. DHS had established Department-wide
practices for public dissemination of regulatory analysis and performance measurement
products and findings. Half of the DHS Components that participated in the FY 2021 capacity
assessment did not have any mechanisms in place for publicly releasing completed products
from evidence-building activities in a timely manner. For the seven Components that
reported having mechanisms in place, those mechanisms were somewhat mature though
maturity varied by evidence-building activity.
43
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
FY 2021 Capacity Assessment
About one in three reported evaluation, research, and analysis studies were disseminated
to the public. Across all four evidence-building activities, most reported studies (69 percent)
were made available to restricted stakeholder groups that include one or more members of
the analysis team, internal (DHS) stakeholders, and external stakeholders. External
stakeholders often included federal and SLTT agency partners, relevant members of private
industry, and those conducting oversight (e.g., Congress, OMB, Government Accountability
Office). Only about one third of all reported studies (31 percent) released all or some portion
of study findings, methods, and deidentified data to the public. Exhibit 35 presents a
summary of the reported release of studies.

Some organizational contexts, including Component culture, practices, and technology
resources, already existed to support evidence production and use in day-to-day
operations, but most respondents reported their Component should not be considered a
role model for evidence use. For 12 of the 14 items used to assess Component context, fewer
than 70% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed their Component had these
characteristics. Most respondents reported that Components valued and rewarded
continuous improvement (76 percent) and encouraged information exchange across the
organization (72 percent). Fewer respondents perceived that Components made it clear what
staff should be doing with evidence (43 percent), had IT systems to efficiently examine data
(46 percent), allowed enough time to integrate evidence in major decision making (45
percent), or prioritized evidence in decision making (57 percent). Exhibit 36 summarizes the
levels of agreement among individual survey respondents with statements about their
Component context. Appendix D provides the full set of items and responses.

While most of the capacity assessment focuses on infrastructure for evidence building, these
data provide important perspective on aspects of organizational culture and practices that can
be targeted in future capacity building efforts to facilitate evidence building and use.
45
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
FY 2021 Capacity Assessment
Opportunities for Improvement
Across all four activities, the assessment team found that capacity for evidence-building and use
is uneven across DHS Components and nascent but developing in some places. Drawing on these
findings, the assessment team presented recommendations that DHS could adopt to strengthen
its evidence-building enterprise.
Establish a strong foundation for evidence building and use. DHS capacity building efforts should
continue to (1) foster shared understanding of evidence-building through common terminology
and concepts consistent with the Evidence Act and OMB guidance to which DHS is accountable;
(2) deepen Component-level understanding of personnel, funding, and other infrastructure
available for evidence-building as well as evidence-building activities that are underway within
the Department; and (3) promote the importance of evidence building and use.
Assess the Department's evidence needs and align evidence-building efforts and resources
with those needs. Beyond a Department-wide learning agenda, developing Component-specific
learning agendas and evaluation plans would enable DHS to comprehensively assess
Components' short and long-term evidence needs, measure Component capacity against those
needs, and appropriately allocate resources to build evidence while targeting gaps in capacity.
Build and sustain evidence building capabilities at the Component level and DHS-wide. To
ensure that evidence building adheres to principles of scientific integrity and rigor, DHS needs to
hire personnel with specialized expertise for evidence building, provide training and time to
develop staff, and establish sufficient budgets to support evidence building activities and procure
external researchers for evidence building. DHS should empower certain evidence-building staff
(or external researchers they manage) with sufficient independence and autonomy to design,
conduct, and appropriately disseminate findings, methods, and data from evidence building.
Aim for continuous improvement of the evidence-building enterprise. DHS should implement
and monitor compliance with existing plans and policies for evidence building and use, and
establish new plans, policies, and mechanisms where needed. Department-wide, evidence
building teams should make plans to improve their efforts, targeting areas identified for
improvement in this assessment.
Promote the dissemination and use of evidence. DHS should consult evidence users and a broad
range of stakeholders to inform evidence-building policies, plans, and activities so they are
relevant and useful. Existing continuous improvement processes should leverage all types of
evidence. DHS and Components should establish new or formalize existing practices to promote
more-consistent use of evidence in programs, policymaking, and business processes. Improving
existing dissemination mechanisms to enable timely release of products and findings to the
broadest audiences possible, including publicly releasing evidence, is a necessary precursor for
ensuring its use in learning, improvement, and accountability to the American public.

Appendix B: Addressing Evidence Act and OMB Requirements
Evidence Act Overview
The Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018 ("Evidence Act"), 19 signed into
law on January 14, 2019, aims to improve the availability and use of evidence to make critical
decisions about government strategy and operations. The Evidence Act emphasizes
collaboration and coordination in developing and using evidence, better use of existing federal
data in evidence-building activities, and open government data. It calls upon the Department to
integrate evidence building into routine practices and policies and to institutionalize using
evidence for organizational learning, continuous improvement, and decision-making. Coupling
better use of evidence building activities with the Administration and Department priorities,
through the strategic plan and other transformative initiatives, will further advance the
Department as a learning organization.
The Evidence Act requires agencies to conduct assessments of their capacity to build and use
evidence, concurrent with the renewal of the strategic plan. The assessment team designed the
capacity assessment to help the Department meet statutory requirements and OMB's intent
that the assessment
"...provide agencies with a baseline against which agencies can measure
improvements to the coverage, quality, methods, effectiveness, and
independence of statistics, evaluation, research, and analyses The Capacity
Assessment will provide senior officials with information needed to fulfill the
Evidence Act's intent to improve the agency's ability to support the
development and use of evaluation, coordinate and increase technical expertise
available for evaluation and related research activities within the agency, and
improve the quality of evaluations and knowledge of evaluation methodology
and standards."20
Collectively, these efforts can improve how the DHS builds and uses evidence, and can better
align management functions, including strategic planning, program and performance
management, resource management, policymaking, data, and evidence-building activities
across the enterprise.
Evidence Act and OMB Requirements
The DHS FY 2021 Capacity Assessment provides information about the extent to which the
Department has the capacity to undertake the activities outlined in the learning agenda and
other evidence-building activities. Exhibit 37 lists Evidence Act and OMB requirements for the
capacity assessment and demonstrates how they have been operationalized for the DHS
capacity assessment.

Evidence-Building Activities
The Evidence Act states that evidence comes from evaluation, research, analysis, and statistics.
OMB provided Agencies with guidance and information to support their interpretation these
broad terms, to include program evaluation, performance measurement, policy analysis, and
research or statistics conducted for foundational fact finding as well as other "activity subtypes"
suggested by OMB's descriptions of those activities. Drawing from the Evidence Act's definition
of evidence and all available OMB guidance, PA&E developed a list of evaluation, research,
analysis, and statistical activities subtypes that should be included or excluded from this
assessment. The in-scope activity subtypes are listed and described in Exhibit 38.

Evaluation
evaluation
Project evaluation of ongoing or completed grantee projects required by DHS grantmaking programs
Basic research: experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of the
underlying foundations of phenomena and observable facts
Applied research: original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge, directed
primarily toward a specific practical aim or objective
Research
Foundational research: describes and documents programs, policies, services, or interventions
currently implemented in the field or eligible and impacted populations and their characteristics
Exploratory research: examines correlational relationships between program- or policy-relevant
constructs to identify logical connections that could form the basis for future programs, policies,
services, or interventions or frameworks to measure their results
Policy and regulatory analysis, typically using cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analysis
Operations research: the development of mathematical models, statistical analyses, simulations, and
analytical reasoning to understand and improve real-world operations
Analysis
Performance measurement and monitoring: ongoing and systematic tracking of data and information
relevant to policies, strategies, programs, projects, or activities, which can include indicators for context,
inputs, process, efficiency, outputs, intermediate outcomes, and outcomes
Statistical activities: The use of data to describe outcomes and descriptors of interest, such as through
Statistics21
estimates of population characteristics, summaries of test results, indices of economic activity,
measures of environmental conditions, and incidence rates for a wide variety of events
Notes: The Evidence Act and OMB guidance do not consider use of data for non-statistical purposes (any
administrative, regulatory, law enforcement adjudicatory, or other purpose that affects the rights, privileges, or
benefits of an identifiable respondent) evidence. Notable other activities that were excluded from this capacity
assessment, informed by OMB guidance, were (1) Audits, inspections, and evaluations conducted by the DHS
Inspector General, Government Accountability Office and other external auditors; and (2) Experimental development
that is directed at the production or improvement of materials, devices, and systems or methods, including the
design, construction and testing of experimental prototypes and technology demonstrations.
21 DHS does not have any designated statistical agencies or activities that are required to comply with the
Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act of 2018 (CIPSEA).

FY 2021 Capacity Assessment
Appendix C. Evidence-Building Activities and Operations Evaluated or
Analyzed
This list includes selected evaluation, research, analysis, and statistics activities that were
conducted, commissioned, or sponsored by DHS since the passage of the Evidence Act that serve
as recent evidence assets for decision making. This list includes a selection of studies identified
in the assessment team's inventory of FY 2021 studies, the DHS annual evaluation plans (FY 2022
and FY 2023), and the Unified Regulatory Agenda. The list also includes studies and analysis
identified by PA&E through a search of DHS, Component, and DHS-sponsored entities' websites.
The list is not intended as an exhaustive list; rather it serves to illustrate a variety of evidence
products (formal reports, analytic documents, statistical summaries, and interactive data
products) that provide decisionmakers and the public with evidence about the Department's
