U.S. Department of Homeland Security
FY 2022-2026 Learning Agenda
About this Report
The Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018 (Evidence Act) requires that the
U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issue an evidence-building plan (or learning agenda)
aligned with the Department's strategic plan describing priority questions and how they will be
addressed through the Department's evidence building.
The DHS FY 2022-2026 Learning Agenda describes a subset of the Department's future evidence-
building activities that align with strategic priorities and how the results of evidence-building
activities will be used. The learning agenda is a plan for the Department's strategic and
coordinated investment of resources in evidence building to ensure the best evidence is available
for pressing decisions and high-priority functions.
As required, the DHS FY 2022-2026 Learning Agenda is published at the DHS public website
and at Evaluation.gov with the Department's other Evidence Act plans and reports.
DHS invites feedback on the DHS FY 2022- 2026 Learning Agenda and continued collaboration
from relevant communities on potential priority questions, data, methods, and analytic
approaches that could guide these and future DHS evidence-building activities. Public feedback
and input may be submitted to: dhslearningagenda@hq.dhs.gov.

Overview
Introduction
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has a diverse and complex mission to prevent
attacks and mitigate threats against the United States and our allies, respond to national
emergencies of all kinds, and advance American prosperity and economic security. Since DHS was
established from its predecessor agencies in 2003, the Department has continued to expand and
mature capabilities to use data and analysis in shaping strategy and operations.
DHS has developed this DHS FY 2022-2026 Learning Agenda to empower Department
decisionmakers to achieve their objectives while fostering organizational learning. The learning
agenda supports the Department's implementation of the Foundations for Evidence Based
Policymaking Act of 2018ยน (Evidence Act) by engaging stakeholders in identifying and prioritizing
areas for evidence to improve program or policy effectiveness, assess progress toward outcomes,
study pilot initiatives and programmatic adjustments, and inform resource management.
Evidence may come from program evaluation, performance measurement, policy analysis, and
research or statistics conducted for foundational fact finding.
The DHS FY 2022-2026 Learning Agenda describes a subset of the Department's future evidence-
building activities that align with strategic priorities and how the results of evidence-building
activities will be used. Except where limitations to public disclosure are noted, DHS intends to
disseminate results on its public website to enable broad use in DHS management activities and
by external stakeholders. DHS will update the learning agenda annually to reflect progress toward
the original priority questions, shifting learning priorities, changing contexts within which the
Department operates, and emerging evidence needs for which new questions and plans will be
added. DHS invites feedback on the DHS FY 2022-2026 Learning Agenda and continued
collaboration from relevant communities to inform these and other evidence-building activities
that may be included in annual updates.
Learning Agenda Development
DHS engaged internal and external stakeholders throughout fiscal year (FY) 2021 to develop the
learning agenda. Collaboration with stakeholders ensures that the Department's learning agenda
addresses questions that are relevant, salient, and meaningful to stakeholders inside and outside
the Department, and that the learning that results from evidence building will be timely and
useful for their decision making. Stakeholder engagement is described below in the context of
each stage of the learning agenda development process, and is ongoing. Exhibit 1 and the
sections that follow outline the key stages in the DHS FY 2022-2026 Learning Agenda
development process.

Engage External Stakeholders
DHS conducted external stakeholder engagement for the learning agenda using well-established
mechanisms and relationships. DHS solicited public input regarding questions or studies that
could guide DHS evidence-building activities through two Requests For Information (RFI). 2
3
Social media campaigns and email outreach to 27,000 private sector partners and committee
members representing industry and trade groups, professional associations, nongovernmental
organizations, advocacy groups, community groups, and the public invited participation in the
RFIs.
Members of the public, industry, research, and state and local government communities
submitted 17 responses through the Federal Registry and email. In addition, DHS directly
engaged other federal agencies, including the Office of Management and Budget, and reviewed
priorities of the Administration and Congress in executive orders and memoranda, Congressional
hearings, and Government Accountability Office (GAO) audits.
Gather Component Questions
DHS gathered employee input for the learning agenda through a variety of activities. Annual
Strategic Reviews, an internal management process conducted to improve program outcomes,
provided the first opportunity to engage senior officials and mission program staff in surfacing
learning priorities. Briefings with Component senior leaders on the learning agenda development
activities sought their priority questions and invited Components' participation.
DHS Components, led by Component members of the DHS Evaluation Officer Council, planned
and conducted Component-specific internal stakeholder engagement activities, using meetings,
workshops, working groups, executive taskers, and employee engagement forums to identify and
prioritize Components' learning agenda questions and proposals. Their activities considered
input from external stakeholder engagement, as well as Administration and Department
leadership priorities. The DHS Evaluation Officer provided flexible tools and guidance to support
Component efforts and hosted weekly webinars and office hours to promote awareness and
workforce engagement in Component-led activities.
The participating Components listed below advanced 122 priority questions and proposals that
were considered for this learning agenda. More organizations within DHS will participate in
subsequent annual activities to update and amend the learning agenda.

Identify Department Priorities
DHS systematically prioritized a set of relevant questions and scientifically rigorous evidence
building from Components' proposals. A working group of 13 senior Department officials and
technical experts,4 with responsibilities for enterprise-wide coordination and governance of
evidence building and data, conducted multiple rounds of systematic review, deliberation, and
prioritization of the Components' priority questions and proposals. The results of a criterion-
based review of questions and accompanying proposals submitted by Components served as the
basis for the working group's prioritization of questions and proposals with high relevance to
Administration priorities and high potential to provide scientifically rigorous, timely evidence for
decision making.
The working group recommended 30 priority questions and proposals to the DHS Deputy's
Management Action Group for inclusion in the learning agenda. Those 30 priority questions
addressed 47 of the 122 Component priority questions when accounting for similar or related
questions. The working group has been reconstituted as a coordination body to continually
promote collaboration and unity of effort across evidence building activities.
4 The working group includes the DHS Evaluation Officer (who is also the Performance Improvement Officer),
the DHS Statistical Official, the DHS Chief Data Officer, the DHS Chief Economist, senior scientific officials from
S&T, senior operations research experts, and their deputies.

Develop Study Plans
Component members of the DHS Evaluation Officer Council and question champions identified
teams to assist the DHS Evaluation Officer in developing study plans. The teams provided subject
matter, evidence-building, and data expertise needed to draft plans for inclusion in the DHS FY
2022-2026 Learning Agenda. Teams considered the Learning Agenda Working Group's feedback
in their planning and engaged additional stakeholders as needed.
Twenty-seven (27) study plans were fully developed during this stage. DHS will establish
additional teams as needed to plan evidence building that may be proposed in future annual
updates of this learning agenda.
Publish and Disseminate
The DHS FY 2022-2026 Learning Agenda is published at the DHS public website and
evaluation.gov. The DHS public website will host future updates on and findings of the evidence
building undertaken from the learning agenda as well as amendments to the learning agenda
that reflect evolving needs. DHS intends to release reports, summaries, and key findings that are
appropriate and accessible for external stakeholders and the public, except in the few cases for
which disclosure limitations are noted in the study plans.
As DHS envisions continual stakeholder engagement on the learning agenda, we invite feedback
on the published DHS FY 2022-2026 Learning Agenda and continued collaboration from relevant
external communities on questions in which data and expertise reside outside DHS, external
researchers have interest in supporting DHS evidence building, and questions reflect shared
priorities or have broad implications beyond DHS.
Learning Agenda Framework
The DHS FY 2022-2026 Learning Agenda is organized according to the strategic goals in the
Department's strategic plan.5 For each goal, the learning agenda identifies priority questions that
build evidence and foster organizational learning. The strategic goals are:
Goal 1: Counter Terrorism and Homeland Security Threats
Goal 2: Secure U.S. Borders and Approaches
Goal 3: Secure Cyberspace and Critical Infrastructure
Goal 4: Preserve and Uphold the Nation's Prosperity and Economic Security
Goal 5: Strengthen Preparedness and Resilience
Goal 6: Champion the DHS Workforce and Strengthen the Department
As required by the Evidence Act, the DHS FY 2022-2026 Learning Agenda questions consider a
broad range of Administration and Department priorities such as domestic terrorism,
immigration, cybersecurity, infrastructure, climate, equity, COVID-19, and the federal workforce.

U.S. Department of Homeland Security
FY 2022-2026 Learning Agenda
The organization of the DHS FY 2022-2026 Learning Agenda is as follows:
The Learning Agenda Summary section outlines summary information for each priority question:
the primary DHS strategic goal and objective number addressed by the question, or
crosscutting if multiple goals are addressed;
the proposed evidence-building activity(s) for each priority question, including
foundational fact finding (FFF), policy analysis (PA), performance measurement (PM), and
program evaluation (PE);
the fiscal year in which evidence building will start; and
the timeframe for expected results, indicated short term (ST) if results are expected FY
2022-2024 and long term (LT) if results are expected in FY 2025-2026, or if the activity is
recurring.
The Study Plans section is organized by strategic goal and provides plans for each priority
question. The study plans describes:
the strategic or operational background for the priority question and the primary strategic
objective addressed;
the proposed evidence building, including the evidence-building activity(s), data,
methods, analysis, and tools needed; and
the anticipated use and dissemination of findings from evidence building.
Three sections provide additional information about DHS evidence building.
The Data Priorities section describes general data types and named data sets that are
proposed for DHS evidence building.
The Study Types, Data collection Methods, and Analytic Approaches section provides
more explanation of commonly used and aspirational aspects of DHS evidence-building
activities.
The Challenges and Mitigating Strategies section describes barriers to evidence building
that are common across DHS organizations and collective solutions DHS is deploying to
overcome such barriers.
The information included in this plan has been collaboratively developed with the Components
that are the principal producers and users of the evidence and meets Evidence Act and OMB
requirements. The details provided ensure that DHS stakeholders have a clear and collective
understanding of what priority evidence building is intended and how it will be used to inform
decision making in the next four years.

Study Plans
Strategic Goal 1: Counter Terrorism and Homeland Security Threats
G1-Q1 In what ways do service interventions funded through violence and domestic
terrorism prevention grants contribute to DHS goals for reducing individuals
radicalizing to targeted violence and terrorism?
DHS Strategic Objective: 1.2 Detect and Disrupt Threats
Timing of Activities: FY 2022-2024
Strategy or Operation Background
Individuals radicalizing to targeted violence and terrorism are a national problem that presents
in different ways among individuals. The DHS Targeted Violence and Terrorism Prevention (TVTP)
program provides federal support for whole-of-society, locally-based initiatives aimed at
preventing radicalization, recruitment, and recidivism through the provision of educational,
technical, and financial assistance. The intended result of these services is preventing individuals
from radicalizing to violence and providing "off ramps" for individuals that are radicalized to
reduce the likelihood of mobilizing to violence. The short period of time that these programs
have operated, combined with many factors that influence the radicalization to violence among
individuals, leaves this effort open for the development of more robust performance
measurement and evaluation efforts.
Evidence Building
Performance Measurement activities will enhance existing grant performance management with
new DHS-developed performance indicators and measures for short- to long-term outcomes that
contribute to TVTP program goals and objectives. Program Evaluation includes primarily
nonexperimental outcome evaluation, but may include impact evaluation, supplemented with
case study analysis of completed TVTP grant projects to determine the extent to which and in
what ways grants have (1) strengthened community resilience through adaptive social
capabilities, (2) improved likelihood of referral and self-referrals to community-based
interventions prior to criminal conduct, and (3) prevented recruitment and deradicalization of at-
risk individuals.
Non-Disaster Grants system contain data on grant services and products, participation,
partnerships, networking, and project-defined outcomes. New data to collect through
performance measures, quantitative surveys, qualitative interviews/focus groups, or
observations (during site visits) may include information from federal grant recipients and their
stakeholders related to DHS-required TVTP program outcomes and new performance measures.
Analytic approaches may include descriptive and inferential statistics for quantitative data,
qualitative data analysis, and case study analysis. Third-party research support is anticipated.

Understanding the effectiveness of targeted violence and terrorism prevention practices on
outcomes will allow DHS, its federal partners, and grant recipients to better shape policies and
programs to implement the national strategic terrorism and targeted prevention strategy
consistent with the Constitution and other applicable law and policy. This effort constitutes a first
step to establish a comprehensive evaluation approach for the broader Center for Prevention
Programs and Partnerships (CP3) portfolio.
Evidence building may engage or be used by CP3, the DHS Science & Technology (S&T) Center of
Excellence for National Counterterrorism Innovation, Technology, and Education researchers,
DHS S&T Social Science Technology Center researchers, CP3 Regional Prevention Coordinators,
FEMA grant recipients, and state and local prevention stakeholders.
Strategic Goal 2: Secure U.S. Borders and Approaches
G2-Q1 What "push" and "pull" factors at the national and local levels predict
increases/decreases in the numbers of noncitizens arriving at the Southwest Border?
DHS Strategic Objective: 2.1 Secure and Manage Air, Land, and Maritime Borders
Timing of Activities: FY 2022-2026
Strategy or Operation Background
Secure, well-managed borders are needed to protect the U.S. against threats from abroad and to
safeguard and expedite the flow of lawful trade and travel. DHS employs near real-time trend
analysis to produce operational planning profiles that inform short-term staffing requirements,
but the Department lacks a long-term model of the underlying social, economic, security, U.S.
policy, and demographic factors that influence immigration.
Evidence Building
Foundational Fact Finding begins with an evidence review of scholarly research publications and
other reports to assist researchers in identifying potential country- and local-level factors and
data to include in the statistical analysis. Relevant data will be acquired and integrated so that
statistical analysis can be conducted to (1) examine relationships among noncitizen border
encounters at the Southwest Border (SWB), noncitizens' residence, and country- and local-level
factors and (2) develop a model that accurately forecasts land-based SWB encounters.
Critical data systems include the U.S. Border Patrol (USBP) E3 System and the Office of Field
Operations (OFO) Unified Secondary system. These and other administrative/operational data
include historic land border encounters and noncitizens' prior residence (i.e., country, state, city)
before encounter. New data to acquire are country- and local-level economic, security, and
environmental conditions from researchers and other federal agencies (e.g., U.S. Department of
State (DOS) and U.S. Agency for International Development) through open data and data sharing

agreements. Analytic approaches may include descriptive and inferential statistics as well as
advanced data mining and analytics. Third party research support is anticipated.
Evidence Use and Dissemination
Understanding and anticipating the numbers of expected encounters at the SWB is critical for
appropriately resourcing DHS operations and coordinating partnerships to reduce unauthorized
flows. Understanding factors that influence migration to the SWB, including root causes like
economic and security conditions as well as dislocation associated with environmental change
and natural disasters, may inform other DHS strategic program efforts, such as interventions
within noncitizens' communities of residence.
Evidence building may engage or be used by the DHS Office of Policy, the CBP Planning, Analysis,
and Requirements Evaluation Directorate, ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations, ICE
Strategy and Operations Analysis unit, ICE Office of the Principal Legal Advisor, DHS Intelligence
and Analysis, USCG Marine Law Enforcement, USCIS Refugee and Asylum and International
Operations division, and other federal partners at Department of Justice, Department of Health
and Human Services, DOS, U.S. Agency for International Development, and the National Security
Council.
G2-Q2 What effect, if any, have changes in southern land border controls had on migrant
encounters at sea?
DHS Strategic Objective: 2.1 Secure and Manage Air, Land, and Maritime Borders
Timing of Activities: FY 2022-2026
Strategy or Operation Background
Sophisticated smuggling enterprises, border tunnels, go-fast vessels, and other elusive travel
methods allow noncitizens and human smugglers to evade border security at designated ports of
entry. DHS deploys a combination of people, technology, infrastructure, and aviation and marine
assets across U.S. land and sea borders and approaches between designated ports of entry. These
assets improve situational awareness of the people, vehicles, aircraft and marine vessels
approaching U.S. land and sea borders and interdiction, as needed, to thwart attempts at
unlawful entry through maritime pathways. Annually reported performance measures include
migrant interdiction effectiveness in the maritime environment and, separately, rate of
interdiction effectiveness along the SWB between ports of entry.6

FY 2022-2026 Learning Agenda
Evidence Building
Foundational Fact Finding includes integration of relevant data and statistical analysis to
examine relationships among noncitizen at-sea encounters, land border encounters, and land
border controls. The activity will also attempt to build a predictive model for at-sea encounters,
or a comprehensive land-marine model of migrant total flow.
USCG Marine Law Enforcement, USBP E3, and OFO Unified Secondary systems include
administrative/operational data for historic at-sea encounters, land border encounters, and land
border controls and, for some data, include state, local, and international law enforcement
partner reporting. Analytic approaches may include descriptive and inferential statistics and
advanced data mining and analytics. This effort may leverage the USCG's planned Surveyor data
aggregation system and tools, or their successors. Given the dependence on evidence and models
in priority question G2-Q1, the start and completion of this work may be delayed.
Evidence Use and Dissemination
Understanding whether and how maritime migration flow changes with stronger or weaker land
border controls and interdiction rates allows DHS to optimize its allocation and positioning of
maritime patrol assets to maximize interdictions of noncitizens and human smugglers attempting
unlawful entry to the U.S.
Evidence building may engage or be used by USCG Office of Maritime Law Enforcement; CBP Air
and Marine Operations, CBP Office of Field Operations, U.S. Border Patrol, ICE Enforcement and
Removal Operations, ICE Homeland Security Investigations, USCIS, DOS Bureau of Population,
Refugees, and Migration, DOS Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, Department
of Defense, Drug Enforcement Agency, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Southern California and
Florida Regional Coordinating Mechanisms, state and local law enforcement, and international
partners.
G2-Q3 How accurate were DHS's estimates of the benefits and costs in the regulatory impact
analysis for the regulation, "Standards to Prevent, Detect, and Respond to Sexual
Abuse and Assault in Confinement Facilities"?
DHS Strategic Objective: 2.3 Enforce U.S. Immigration Laws
Timing of Activities: FY 2022-2023
12
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
FY 2022-2026 Learning Agenda
Strategy or Operation Background
Executive Order (E.O.) 12866 of September 30, 1993, Regulatory Planning and Review,7 begins
with the premise, "The American people deserve a regulatory system that works for them and
improves the performance of the economy without imposing unacceptable or unreasonable
costs on society regulations that are effective, consistent, sensible, and understandable." It is
with these and related societal goals in mind that an assessment of both the potential costs and
benefits of the intended regulation is generally performed by Federal regulatory agencies when
they propose new regulations. E.O. 12866 directs that agencies shall assess both the costs and
the benefits of intended regulations "and, recognizing that some costs and benefits are difficult
to quantify, propose or adopt a regulation only upon a reasoned determination that the benefits
of the intended regulation justify its costs." It further advises that such decisions should be based
on "the best reasonably obtainable scientific, technical, economic, and other information
concerning the need for, and consequences of, the intended regulation." The Executive Order
recognizes that reasoned prediction of the benefits and costs of an intended regulation is
generally, challenging. Accordingly, it is useful for agencies to analyze costs and benefits
retrospectively in order to determine how accurate their predictions have been by examining the
actual costs and benefits of their regulations.
Different regulatory agencies face their own unique challenges in performing analyses of costs
and benefits due to the characteristics of their subject areas. DHS's regulations involving the
management of confinement facilities belongs to a unique subject area that warrants special
consideration in the development of regulatory analyses at DHS. By retrospectively assessing
costs and benefits performed for a recent regulation in this area, DHS will be able to learn more
about the efficacy of its predictive analytical methods, which will better enable DHS to perform
more accurate benefit-cost analyses in this subject area moving forward. For this purpose, DHS
chose the analysis for a significant, relatively recent regulation for which the prediction of
benefits and costs were challenging: Standards to Prevent, Detect, and Respond to Sexual Abuse
and Assault in Confinement Facilities. 8
Evidence Building
Program Evaluation activities include a summative economic analysis, or evaluation, to
determine actual benefits and costs of the rule, compared with the original projection of costs
and benefits. Existing data may include all of the data that DHS used in developing the original
regulatory analysis (for example, data on costs of personnel, training, documentation, and audits
and industry estimates of unit avoidance values for sexual abuse), plus any other, more-recent
data from the same sources. An evidence review, such as a literature review, may provide

alternative sources of related information from scholarly research publications, research and
analysis reports of other federal agencies, or other federal staff with subject matter expertise in
the topic area of the regulation. Analytic approaches may include descriptive and inferential
statistics, benefit-cost or break-even analysis, and qualitative data analysis. Third party research
support is anticipated.
Evidence Use and Dissemination
Comparing actual benefits and costs of the rule with the original analysis baseline and projected
estimates, and how critical assumptions informed those estimates, will provide valuable lessons
for improving DHS regulatory analyses. Recommendations on how DHS assessments of costs and
benefits could be improved, as suggested from findings, will be shared among DHS regulatory
economists who work in related areas so that their own assessments of costs and benefits may
benefit from these recommendations in the future.
Evidence building may engage or be used by ICE Office of Regulatory Affairs and Policy, DHS Office
of the General Counsel Regulatory Affairs Law Division, regulatory agencies within DHS, and
regulatory agencies in other Departments that perform similar work.
G2-Q4 What, if any, person and case characteristics predict higher likelihood of specific
immigration enforcement outcomes and time between border encounter and final
outcome?
DHS Strategic Objective: 2.3 Enforce U.S. Immigration Laws
Timing of Activities: FY 2022-2026
Strategy or Operation Background
The U.S. immigration enforcement system is the most complex of the Department's interagency
missions and until recently data systems have hindered analysis of individuals' history across the
enforcement lifecycle. DHS established and continues to mature an immigration data domain
to standardize immigration data collection and link records across the Department, though a
Department-wide approach to collecting critical individual data needed to identify
individuals from underserved groups such as race, ethnicity, sexual orientation and gender
identity (SOGI), and disability is still needed. One intended result is improved analysis of
structural factors and individual characteristics that influence enforcement outcomes and end-
to-end processing times, including disparate outcomes in immigration enforcement. DHS
summarizes immigration enforcement in the Immigration Enforcement Actions Annual Flow
Report,9 and the annual Enforcement Lifecycle Report10 describes final or most current outcomes
associated with previous SWB encounters.

U.S. Department of Homeland Security
FY 2022-2026 Learning Agenda
Evidence Building
Foundational Fact Finding includes continued data integration and then statistical analysis to
examine specific relationships between noncitizen individual factors and enforcement outcomes,
individual factors and end-to-end processing times, case factors and enforcement outcomes, and
case factors and end-to-end processing times. Individual characteristics are citizenship and
country's willingness to accept deportees, statelessness, sex, language, age, family status,
immigration status at time of arrest, and criminality. Case factors include initial disposition, arrest
location, detention center, basis of claim, transfers, Alternatives to Detention enrollment, legal
representation, court location, and immigration judge. Enforcement outcomes include positive
credible/fear determinations, removals, removals in absentia, unexecuted removals, and relief
from return.
The Office of Immigration Statistics (OIS) Statistical Immigration System of Record contains most
of the information needed on individual characteristics, case factors, outcomes, and processing
times. Additional DHS administrative data that may support evidence building include ICE
Alternatives to Detention data, DHS Prison Rape Elimination Act data, other data collected by the
Immigration Detention Ombudsman and Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL). New
data to collect or acquire include race, ethnicity, SOGI status, and disability from certain
noncitizens. DHS will attempt to access these data from other federal statistical data (e.g., U.S.
Census data) through restricted use data licenses and data linking. Alternatively, DHS may
consider creating new, standardized form fields for collecting these data across the immigration
data domain. Analytic approaches may include descriptive and inferential statistics. Third party
research support is not anticipated.
Evidence Use and Dissemination
Understanding how individual characteristics and case-related factors influence enforcement
outcomes and processing times can help DHS identify issues that warrant further analysis and
evaluation, improve enforcement processes and enforcement priorities, reduce litigation risk,
and mitigate disparate enforcement outcomes. Evidence building may engage or be used by the
DHS Office of Policy, Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman, CRCL, the CBP Planning,
Analysis, and Requirements Evaluation Directorate, ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations,
ICE Office of the Principal Legal Advisor, the Department of Justice Executive Office for
Immigration Review, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Refugee
Resettlement, organizations providing legal orientation programs, and numerous external
immigration research and advocacy organizations.
G2-Q5 What factors, if any, help predict rates and lengths of nonimmigrant overstays?
DHS Strategic Objective: 2.3 Enforce U.S. Immigration Laws
Timing of Activities: FY 2022-2026
15
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
FY 2022-2026 Learning Agenda
Strategy or Operation Background
While only a small percentage of nonimmigrant visitors overstay their authorized period of
admission, overstayers make up 40-50 percent of the total U.S. unauthorized immigrant
population. DHS has instituted various initiatives to proactively prevent overstay violations, such
as direct notifications to nonimmigrant visitors, outreach, and education programs. Yet the
Department has only recently developed reliable data on certain nonimmigrant exits, and data
on overstayers is contingent on the Department's still-evolving ability to track nonimmigrant
adjustments of status and departures through land ports of entry. Each fiscal year, DHS publishes
an annual Entry/Exit Overstay Report11 that provides country-by-country overstay rates for a
subset of air and sea nonimmigrant classes of admission.
Evidence Building
Foundational Fact Finding includes data integration, additional data validation, and then
statistical analysis to examine relationships among individual factors, visa type/class of
admission, likelihood of overstay, and length of overstay. These data will be incorporated into
the OIS Statistical Immigration System of Record to improve statistics reported in OIS's
Estimates of the Unauthorized Immigrant Population Residing in the United States.
Existing data from the OIS Statistical Immigration System of Record and CBP Arrival and
Departure Information System provide information on nonimmigrant individual characteristics
(such as country of birth, sex, race, ethnicity, language), citizenship, visa type/class of admission,
inflow-outflow, and overstay resolutions. Additional research and data on visa issuance and
overstays may be acquired from the DOS. Analytic approaches may include descriptive and
inferential statistics. Third party research support is not anticipated.
Evidence Use and Dissemination
Understanding whether and what factors predict future visa overstays can inform DHS and DOS
policies about visa issuance and admissions, improve preventative measures to deter violations,
and ensure appropriate resourcing for DHS visa overstay enforcement operations. The OIS will
also use available data on overstay lengths to strengthen its estimates of the resident
unauthorized population. Evidence building may engage or be used by DHS Office of Policy, CBP
Office of Field Operations, ICE Homeland Security Investigations, and the Department of State
Offices of Consular Affairs and Fraud Prevention.
G2-Q6 What, if any, person and case characteristics predict higher likelihood of receiving
specific immigration benefits?

16
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
FY 2022-2026 Learning Agenda
Timing of Activities: FY 2022-2025
Strategy or Operation Background
DHS adjudicates about eight million requests for immigration benefits a year; however, until
recently, data systems have hindered analysis of individuals' history across the benefits lifecycle,
including the pathways noncitizens follow in transitioning from temporary nonimmigrants to
lawful permanent residents to naturalized citizens. DHS established and continues to mature an
immigration data domain to standardize immigration data collection and practices and link
records across the Department. A Department-wide approach to collecting critical individual
characteristics such as race, ethnicity, and SOGI is still needed.
DHS currently summarizes immigration benefits in separate annual reports: U.S. Nonimmigrant
Admissions,
12
Refugees and Asylees,13 U.S. Lawful Permanent Residents (LPRs), 14 and U.S.
Naturalizations. 15 This study would serve as the basis of a future Immigration Benefits Lifecycle
Report that maps non-citizens' pathways across different nonimmigrant statuses and identifies
case- and individual-level factors that are associated with different application rates and results,
including potential disparities in benefits outcomes.
Evidence Building
Foundational Fact Finding includes data integration and then statistical analysis to examine
relationships among case- and individual-level factors and benefit applications and outcomes for
each application type.
Critical data systems for evidence building include the OIS Statistical Immigration System of
Record and USCIS Electronic Immigration System, USCIS Computer Linked Application
Information Management System, and Central Index System. These existing data provide
information on individual characteristics, case factors, adjudicator characteristics,
application/form, and benefit outcomes. Individual characteristics are country of birth, country
of nationality, sex, education, occupation, and limited data on race, ethnicity, and language. Case
factor data includes nonimmigrant and LPR class of admission, relationship to US sponsor, and
adjudicator. Key benefit outcomes include nonimmigrant visa renewal, adjustment to LPR status,
and naturalization. New data to collect or acquire include race, ethnicity, SOGI, education,
language, occupation, and English language proficiency for some noncitizens. DHS will attempt
to access these data from other federal statistical data (e.g., U.S. Census data) through restricted
use data licenses for data linking to DHS data; alternatively, DHS may consider creating new,
standardized form fields for collecting these data across the immigration data domain. Analytic

Evidence Use and Dissemination
Understanding how noncitizen individual characteristics and case-related factors influence
specific outcomes enables DHS to identify issues that warrant further analysis and evaluation,
improve immigration benefits processes and programs, reduce DHS litigation risk, and mitigate
disparate outcomes in the benefits system. Evidence building may engage or be used by the DHS
Office of Policy, CRCL, USCIS Field Operations Directorate, USCIS Ombudsman, USCIS Office of
Citizenship, USCIS Office of Policy, and numerous external immigration research and advocacy
organizations.
G2-Q7 What are the characteristics of people who naturalize? What demographic variables
among lawful permanent residents are correlated with the likelihood and timing of
naturalization?
DHS Strategic Objective: 2.4 Administer Immigration Benefits to Advance the Security and
Prosperity of the Nation
Timing of Activities: FY 2022-2025
Strategy or Operation Background
The U.S. immigration system must be responsive to the flow of demand from around the world
while safeguarding security and prosperity of the Nation. DHS provides customer-oriented
immigration benefits and information services at home and abroad that promote rights,
responsibilities, and importance of citizenship. A seven-agency Interagency Working Group is
currently developing a comprehensive national strategy to promote naturalization for qualified
noncitizens. The intended result is more noncitizens lawfully reaching their potential in the U.S.
through naturalization.
On a periodic basis, DHS reports on characteristics of people who naturalized,16 describing
demographic and socio-economic characteristics of lawful permanent residents (LPR) that
naturalized in a particular timespan (typically, five years). DHS also reports trends in
naturalization rates17 describing naturalization for immigrants who obtained LPR status by
immigrant cohort, region and country of birth, and class of admission. The statistics produced
from this priority question will support future updates and provide new information for
expanding these reports.

18
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
FY 2022-2026 Learning Agenda
Evidence Building
Foundational Fact Finding involves statistical analysis to describe group characteristics of people
who naturalize and statistical comparison of characteristics and outcomes of different LPR
cohorts. An analysis of time-to-event (event being naturalization) will estimate and describe the
naturalization-eligible population and identify factors that increase probability to naturalize.
Data from the USCIS Electronic Immigration System, USCIS Computer Linked Application
Information Management System, and Central Index System data, mainly collected in I-485 and
N-400s forms, provide information on individual, socioeconomic, and case characteristics.
Individual and socioeconomic characteristics include region and country of birth, age, gender,
marital status, education attainment, and income. Case characteristics includes years in LPR
status and class of admission. No new data collection is anticipated. Analytic approaches may
include descriptive and inferential statistics. Third party research support is not anticipated.
Evidence Use and Dissemination
Understanding trends in the characteristics of people who naturalize, factors that increase
probability of naturalization, and projected future naturalization volume enables DHS to better
promote naturalization through national and community-level outreach efforts, support
workload planning for efficient naturalization request processing, and inform rulemaking for
naturalization fees.
Evidence building may engage or be used by USCIS' Office of Citizenship, Field Operations
Directorate, Office of Performance and Quality, and Office of the Chief Financial Officer, as well
as the Interagency Working Group on Promoting Naturalization, which includes Departments of
Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and others. Organizations preparing lawful
permanent residents for citizenship or conducting outreach to lawful permanent residents about
citizenship would also benefit from understanding existing naturalization trends to tailor services.
G2-Q8 What are characteristics of people who online file compared to paper file for
immigration benefits?
DHS Strategic Objective: 2.4 Administer Immigration Benefits to Advance the Security and
Prosperity of the Nation
Timing of Activities: FY 2022-2024
Strategy or Operation Background
The U.S. immigration system must be responsive to the flow of demand from around the world
while safeguarding security and prosperity of the Nation. DHS has established electronic filing
procedures for a select number of application and petitions for immigration benefits that
provides information needed to make immigration decisions to appropriate agencies elec-
tronically and in real-time, yet only 30-60 percent of those applications are filed online. Increasing
19
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
FY 2022-2026 Learning Agenda
the proportion of online filers improves public access to government information and services,
and government efficiency in adjudication of applications and petitions for immigration benefits.
Evidence Building
Foundational Fact Finding involves statistical analysis to describe group characteristics and
statistical comparison of people who do and do not online file.
Critical data systems include USCIS Electronic Immigration System, USCIS Computer Linked
Application Information Management System, and Enterprise Citizenship and Immigration
Services Centralized Operational Repository (eCISCOR). These existing administrative/
operational data contain information on individual and socioeconomic characteristics and
application or petition type. Individual and socioeconomic characteristics include region and
country of birth, age, gender, marital status, education, and income. Although new data
collection is not anticipated, the results of evidence building may inform future research and
related data collection to better understand benefits, deterrents, and challenges of online filing
from program customers. Analytic approaches may include descriptive and inferential statistics.
Third party research support is not anticipated.
Evidence Use and Dissemination
Understanding trends in the characteristics of applicants and petitioners that do and do not
online file could assist DHS in identifying potential inequities among the two populations. Further,
factors that correlate to filing behaviors may indicate whether or not the service is accessible and
usable by everyone who needs it and may shed additional light on barriers to entry for use of
these services. These new understandings may help DHS improve the online filing process to
better address customer needs and identify where additional analysis or evaluation is needed.
Evidence building may engage or be used by USCIS' Office of Performance and Quality, Citizenship
and Applicant Information Services, Office of Information Technology, Office of Information and
Document Production, Office of Policy and Strategy, External Affairs Directorate, Public Affairs,
and multiple other USCIS offices and directorates responsible for immigration services.
Immigrant stakeholder groups and researchers may also benefit from this research.
G2-Q9 What is the degree and source of variability in USCIS utilization and completion rates,
across adjudicative staff, at USCIS field offices?
DHS Strategic Objective: 2.4 Administer Immigration Benefits to Advance the Security and
Prosperity of the Nation
Timing of Activities: FY 2022
20
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
FY 2022-2026 Learning Agenda
Strategy or Operation Background
DHS adjudicates about eight million requests for immigration benefits a year, and variability
exists across adjudicative staff, at DHS (USCIS) field offices and Service Centers, and across
workload streams. DHS regularly assesses adjudication efficiency metrics such as the utilization
rate (the percentage of officer work time devoted to adjudication) and completion rate (the time
it takes to adjudicate each benefit type, on average). This information is critical for determining
optimal agency staffing, staffing needed to address the backlog, and new or changing workloads.
Evidence Building
Foundational Fact Finding includes statistical analysis of benefit adjudication to include
a
comparison of utilization and completion rates across adjudicative staff and field offices by
application/petition form types. Adjudication milestones and workload effort will also be
reviewed to understand variation in efficiency metrics and correlation with other operational
factors that may affect these rates.
Critical data systems include the USCIS Electronic Immigration System, USCIS Computer Linked
Application Information Management System, and eSTAT. Existing data includes the aggregated
efficiency metrics used in annual performance measures, but the analysis relies on detailed and
comprehensive information on milestones, history action codes, process time stamps, and officer
case histories. Existing data are sufficient for form types that have already transitioned into the
USCIS Electronic Immigration System (ELIS). Data from forms that are not yet in ELIS may be less
comprehensive. Policy, guidance, and other information will be gathered and reviewed as
needed to identify relevant operational factors, such as individual-level data entry practices or
office-level management practices that may be needed to fully understand sources of variability.
Analytic approaches may include descriptive and inferential statistics and advanced data mining
and analytics. Third party research support is not anticipated.
Evidence Use and Dissemination
Understanding trends in adjudication between officers and offices will help DHS to identify best
practices for efficiency, optimize interview scheduling, and help to reduce case backlogs. The
analysis will improve the accuracy and utility of the efficiency metrics that are key inputs to
staffing allocation models. If successful, the analysis will be scaled to include the USCIS Service
Center Operations Directorate. Evidence building may engage or be used by USCIS operational
directorates, Field Operations Directorate, Project Management Office, Office of Performance
and Quality, and the Office of the Chief Financial Officer. Disclosure of findings will be limited to
DHS.
G2-Q10 To what extent can available data predict adjudications actions sufficiently to
warrant automation of steps toward completion or to automate whole processes?
DHS Strategic Objective: 2.4 Administer Immigration Benefits to Advance the Security and
Prosperity of the Nation
21
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
FY 2022-2026 Learning Agenda
Timing of Activities: FY 2022-2023
Strategy or Operation Background
The eight million requests for immigration benefits received by DHS annually arrive unevenly
across the year, creating surges that challenge the inelasticity of DHS workforce, facilities, and
budgets. DHS is working towards greater transparency in its operations, reductions in application
backlogs, and revised methods of estimating completion times for all application types.
Automating adjudication processes across the immigration benefits portfolio would allow DHS to
be more responsive to customer demand. These improvements would provide applicants,
employers, and communities a much-needed sense of economic and social stability. Automation
could result in reallocation of resources to more valuable workloads, or, for example, prevent
need for increasing costs while simultaneously decreasing the length of time an applicant waits
for their results, thus reducing barriers to immigration.
Evidence Building
Foundational Fact Finding includes statistical analysis to examine which factors, if any, in the
immigration benefit life cycle can be used as the basis of a model for predicting case approvals,
specifically. An assumption in this research is that denials should be handled by humans.
The analysis will use only those data which affect the legal evaluation of a case. For example,
individual characteristics such as country of birth are valid because they are required to know
if
a visa is available for entry, whereas data on race or eye color are not relevant. Critical
administrative/operational data include case factors (such as preference category or relationship
to US sponsor) and contextual factors such as risk indicators (such as Treasury Enforcement
Communication System hits or known association with fraud). The evidence building aims to test
if currently available data and analytical systems are sufficient to perform the research; thus, no
new data collection is anticipated. Analytic approaches may include descriptive and inferential
statistics, advanced data mining and analytics, and network analysis. Third party research support
is not anticipated.
Evidence Use and Dissemination
Several preceding learning agenda questions provide foundational analyses about sources of
variation in immigration benefit processes and outcomes to help identify conditions under which
automation is most needed and appropriate. In this research, understanding what variables can
be used to assess or index case complexity will help to properly identify cases for which
automated application processing is appropriate. Further, understanding the extent to which
current cases can undergo automated processing helps DHS to better align its staffing resources.
A meaningful derivative use of the data, for example, is that if DHS can precisely predict outcomes
in processes, the same data may support workload forecasting.

Strategic Goal 3: Secure Cyberspace and Critical Infrastructure
G3-Q1 How are stakeholders using cyber, critical infrastructure (CI), and emergency
communications (EC) products and services they receive from CISA? To what extent do
these products and services add value, such as increasing awareness and closing gaps
in capabilities, plans, and policies? What factors prevent stakeholders from using
cyber/CI/EC products they receive?
DHS Strategic Objective: 3.2 Strengthen the Security and Resilience of Critical Infrastructure
Timing of Activities: FY 2022
Strategy or Operation Background
Critical infrastructure supports our Nation's national security, public health and safety and
economic growth. These vital services must be protected against an increasing set of digital,
physical, man-made and natural threats to avoid devastating disruptions to the economic
security, health, and well-being of all Americans. Critical infrastructure is susceptible to
cyberattacks and natural disasters. To strengthen the security and resilience of critical
infrastructure, DHS works with federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) and private sector
stakeholders through national programs. Through these programs, which are primarily voluntary,
DHS conducts vulnerability and consequence assessments, supports exercises, and provides
information and solutions for countering emerging threats and hazards.
Evidence Building
Program Evaluation includes non-experimental outcome evaluations of CISA's High Value Assets
(HVA) and National Exercises programs. The evaluations may address process evaluation
questions but will primarily examine the extent to which participating stakeholders access,
understand, and use cyber, CI, and EC products and services to take risk-mitigating corrective
actions. The findings of the program evaluation may inform new performance measure
development or revision of existing measures.
Existing data include stakeholder satisfaction and short-term stakeholder corrective actions from
the HVA Assessment database, National Exercises After Action Reports, and customer
satisfaction surveys, such as from the HVA Survey administered by the U.S. Office of Personnel
Management. New data to collect through quantitative surveys and qualitative interviews/focus
groups include CISA stakeholders' views of the value and utility of CISA products and services,

the long-term corrective actions taken, factors that influence stakeholders' use of CISA products
and services, the benefits and unintended consequences of use, and unmet needs that could be
addressed by improving HVA, Exercises, or other CISA programs. Analytic approaches may
include descriptive statistics and qualitative data analysis. Third party research support is
anticipated.
Evidence Use and Dissemination
Understanding stakeholders' use of products and services and the factors that influence
voluntary compliance, enables DHS to more effectively serve its stakeholders. This information
helps DHS identify priority areas for improvement and, in response, refine the portfolio of
products and services to secure high rates of compliance with standards and guidelines.
Evidence building will engage, or be used by, CISA's operational divisions charged with developing
and executing products and services (Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Security, Emergency
Communications, Integrated Operations, Stakeholder Engagement, and the National Risk
Management Center). Evidence may also be used by external stakeholder governance and
coordinating councils, and the target stakeholder populations for CISA services and products.
G3-Q2 Do all subgroups of the target population participate in and perceive value and utility
of national convenings as mechanisms of information exchange about security and
risk resilience? What gaps and unmet needs, if any, exist?
DHS Strategic Objective: 3.2 Strengthen the Security and Resilience of Critical Infrastructure
Timing of Activities: FY 2023
Strategy or Operation Background
Critical infrastructure supports our Nation's security, public health, safety, and economic growth.
These vital services must be protected against an increasing set of digital, physical, man-made
and natural threats to avoid devastating disruptions to the economic security, health, and well-
being of all Americans. To strengthen the security and resilience of critical infrastructure, DHS
works with federal, SLTT, and private sector stakeholders through national programs. National
convenings, including councils (Federal Senior Leadership Council and SLTT Government
Coordination Councils), committees, and informal sector management forums, enable
information exchange between DHS and its stakeholders.
Evidence Building
Program Evaluation includes non-experimental outcome evaluation of CISA's national
convenings. The evaluation may include process evaluation questions but will primarily examine
the extent to which DHS staff and participating stakeholders believe that the national convenings
(1) provide information that is meaningful, practical, and specific and (2) offer unique
opportunities to exchange information across sectors.
24
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
FY 2022-2026 Learning Agenda
Existing administrative/operational data contain information on delivered convenings,
stakeholder participation in convenings, and stakeholder satisfaction; these data will expand with
the administration of new Paperwork Reduction Act-approved questions that are not yet in use.
New data to collect or acquire may include in-depth information from DHS staff and stakeholders
through quantitative surveys and qualitative interviews/focus groups about the value and utility
of national convenings as mechanisms for relationship-building and information exchange across
sectors, how information obtained from the convenings has been used to improve DHS programs
to mitigate risk, and unmet needs that could be addressed with improvement to the convenings
or other CISA programs. Analytic approaches may include descriptive statistics and qualitative
data analysis. Third party research support is anticipated.
Evidence Use and Dissemination
Developing a better understanding of the extent to which national convenings offer meaningful
information exchange between CISA and its stakeholders will enable improvements to CISA
products and services. Specifically, the evaluation will be used to identify areas for improvement
in
how CISA collaborates and interacts with stakeholders and, in response to prioritized practices
that best support information exchange for infrastructure security and risk resiliency.
Evidence building may engage and/or be used by CISA's Stakeholder Engagement Division,
operational divisions (Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Security, Emergency Communications,
Integrated Operations), and the target stakeholder populations for the convenings.
G3-Q3 To what extent has the all-hazards communications unit position-specific training and
stakeholder communication unit program enhanced interoperability by (1) creating,
maintaining, and deploying a qualified group of people to fulfill Communications Unit
(COMU) roles in federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) partner organizations
and (2) enhancing integrated, collaborative, communications planning?
DHS Strategic Objective: 3.2 Strengthen the Security and Resilience of Critical Infrastructure
Timing of Activities: FY 2023
Strategy or Operation Background
Information exchange, situational awareness, and resource prioritization among emergency
managers, first responders, and across public and private sectors is vital during catastrophic
incidents and events. DHS provides targeted training, technical assistance, and strategic advice
and guidance to prepare and support a diverse cadre to fill a variety of critical emergency
communications response roles in federal and SLTT partner organizations. The intended result of
these efforts is a qualified cadre of COMU-credentialed responders that can enable continuity of
communications during a catastrophic incident or event. Other research and reporting from the
Nationwide Communications Baseline Assessments and SAFECOM Nationwide Surveys help DHS
25
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
FY 2022-2026 Learning Agenda
to identify evolving capability needs and gaps, major market shifts, and progress toward
establishing and sustaining emergency response communications.
Evidence Building
Performance Measurement includes the development of new incident measures for emergency
communications and State Interoperability Markers. Current measures include (1)
communications leader training and adoption and (2) communications exercise objectives. All
state measures are self-assessed and scored by states as one of three levels: defined, initial, or
optimized. New measures may indicate the rate of accomplishing national emergency goals,
number of jurisdictional conflicts, and rates of backup power, overlapping coverage, and route
diversity. Program Evaluation will consist of a non-experimental outcome evaluation with
embedded process evaluation questions to determine COMU role-specific training effectiveness
and areas for improvement.
Existing data, such as number and type of COMU-credentialed responders support performance
measurement and program evaluation. New data to collect for program evaluation may include
information on satisfaction and self-reported learning from trainees through quantitative surveys
and qualitative interviews and focus groups. Incident communications position utilization,
activities performed, and communications and IT management structure for incidents and
planned events will be gathered through Incident Communications Activity Reports. Analytic
approaches may include descriptive statistics and qualitative data analysis. Third party research
support is anticipated.
Evidence Use and Dissemination
Understanding availability, readiness, and use of trainees for specific types of COMU roles and
how they enrich communications planning in Federal and SLTT partner organizations enables DHS
to update training products and services, recommend improvements to the National Incident
Management System and Incident Command Systems architecture, and better assist partner
organizations in prioritizing and addressing COMU gaps.
CISA's Emergency Communications Division (ECD) leads these efforts on behalf of the
Department to assure vital information exchange, situational awareness, and resource
prioritization among emergency managers, first responders, and across public and private sectors
is both reliable and resilient during catastrophic incidents and events. Evidence-building would
be used by the CISA Emergency Communications Division to engage FEMA, Federal, and SLTT
partners, and technical assistance providers to improve plans that build and sustain capabilities
to maintain readiness.
External stakeholder governance and coordinating councils, such as SAFECOM and the National
Council of Statewide Interoperability Coordinators (NCSWIC), will also benefit from the evidence.
SAFECOM is a stakeholder-supported public safety communications program administered by
CISA working with federal government entities to improve emergency response providers' inter-
26
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
FY 2022-2026 Learning Agenda
jurisdictional and interdisciplinary emergency communications interoperability across regional,
SLTT, and international borders. NCSWIC is comprised of Statewide Interoperability Coordinators
and their alternates from the 56 States and territories. NCSWIC works with public safety
responders in their respective regions, state, or territory to create governance structures that
promote and enhance interoperable communications.

to appropriately manage risk?
DHS Strategic Objective: 4.2 Safeguard the U.S. Transportation System
Timing of Activities: FY 2022-2024
Strategy or Operation Background
Critical maritime infrastructure security requires protecting facilities from unauthorized access
that occurs when established security measures are circumvented, eluded, or violated.
Installation of Transportation Worker Identification Card (TWIC) readers at maritime facilities
regulated under the Maritime Transportation Security Act could be used to integrate perimeter
security, access control, and personnel security. TWIC readers could be a cost-effective approach
to
detecting threats of and reducing risks posed by unauthorized access to or within specific
maritime facilities.
Evidence Building
Foundational Fact Finding includes ongoing research to develop an assessment methodology
that assigns a quantitative risk level to select appropriate maritime facilities. Policy Analysis
includes formative economic analysis that will use the developed risk model to assess costs and
benefits (benefit-cost analysis) of TWIC at certain high-risk facilities.
CISA Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards and marine facility Risk Management Plans data
provide information about maritime facility chemicals of interest inventory, personnel,
vulnerability, site security, management plans, and security breaches at high-risk maritime
facilities. New data to be collected or acquired include marine facility risk-related threats and
consequences through a quantitative survey of maritime facilities and total costs of TWIC Readers
from industry data. Analytic approaches may include descriptive and inferential statistics as well
as benefit-cost or break-even analysis. Third party research support is anticipated.
Evidence Use and Dissemination
Understanding the relative costs and risk-reduction benefits of TWIC readers at specific maritime
facilities allows DHS to determine whether and for which facilities new or revised rulemaking

G4-Q2 What are the most significant sources of variation in transportation security sector
(TSS) operators' implementation of cyber security technology and processes? What do
TSS operators report as enablers and barriers to implementation, and what
gaps/unmet needs could TSA address?
DHS Strategic Objective: 4.2 Safeguard the U.S Transportation System
Timing of Activities: FY 2022
Strategy or Operation Background
The U.S. transportation system's cyber environment and infrastructure are vulnerable to a wide
range of continuously evolving risks stemming from both cyber and physical threats and hazards.
DHS assesses and provides security and mitigation guidance through several outreach and
information sharing activities. The intended result is that transportation systems sector (TSS)
owners and operators mitigate the most significant cyber risks to transportation infrastructure
that could impact national security, public health and safety, and economic security and improve
the resiliency of the TSS. DHS monitors how TSS owners and operators implement risk mitigation
in accordance with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity
Framework. 18 DHS is currently building measures to monitor cybersecurity incidents that have an
actual or potential operational impact and has issued three security directives and three national
security program amendments, which require owners and operators of certain pipeline, railroad,
public transit, and aviation sectors to report cybersecurity incidents to DHS.
Evidence Building
Foundational Fact Finding includes a needs assessment that examines the needs of the target
populations that, when addressed, result in improved implementation of risk-mitigating critical
cybersecurity technology and processes across TSS operator characteristics. The assessment will
explore the nature and causes of those needs, set priorities for the future, and consider what
adjustments in the Department's approach could better support TSS operators in advancing
resilience of the TSS.

Validated Architecture Design Reviews (VADRs). 19 These existing data include TSS operator
characteristics (sector, size, ownership), security posture, and number and nature of
recommended risk mitigation activities undertaken. Collectively these data may provide initial
insights to challenges of adopting the NIST Cybersecurity Framework,20 including mitigation
activities, and serve as the foundation of case studies. New data to collect from TSS operators
through a quantitative survey and qualitative interviews/focus groups include barriers and
challenges to implementation of risk mitigation. Analytic approaches may include descriptive and
inferential statistics, qualitative data analysis, and case study analysis. Third party research
support is anticipated.
Evidence Use and Dissemination
Understanding factors that influence implementation of risk mitigation across different sectors
and operators will enable DHS to improve its approach (including exercising its statutory and
regulatory authorities in different ways and to the extent necessary) for ensuring the resilience
of the transportation security sector. Evidence building may engage or be used by TSA Security
Operations and Operation Support directorates, CISA's Vulnerability Management, National Risk
Management Center, Stakeholder Engagement, and Cybersecurity Division. Results could also be
used by sector risk management agencies, policy makers, industry partners and higher education
centers to inform decision making and further research.
G4-Q3 Where does the majority of federally managed fishing activity (both inside the U.S.
Exclusive Economic Zone and nearby) occur, by season and species?
DHS Strategic Objective: 4.3 Maintain U.S. Waterways and Maritime Resources
Timing of Activities: FY 2022
Strategy or Operation Background
The U.S. has the largest Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in the world, encompassing over 2.25
million square miles and 90,000 miles of coastline. DHS, in partnership with the National
Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), provides at-sea enforcement of
applicable fisheries regulations. The intended result is achieving national goals for living marine
resource conservation and management, including protection of marine mammals and
endangered species.
19 In 2021, TSA conducted over 50 VDARs on pipelines. In 2022, TSA has leveraged contracted support to make
Cyber Security Evaluation Tool (CSET) available to all surface transportation owner/operators to perform self-
evaluations. CSETยฎ is a stand-alone desktop application that guides asset owners and operators through a
systematic process of evaluating Operational Technology and Information Technology.

fishing activity in and near the U.S. EEZ.
USCG Automatic Identification System and Marine Law Enforcement, NOAA Vessel Monitoring
System, NOAA Commercial Fisheries Landings, and NOAA Alaska Region Catch in Area provide
critical data for evidence building. These include information on fishing vessel positions, fisheries
boardings, activities at boarding, regulation compliance, and interdiction of foreign fishing
vessels violating U.S. waters. New data to collect or acquire may include fish stock location,
migration, and seasonality as well as landings and catch data from other federal agency regional
scientific data sets. Non-federal data on fishing activity, fisheries management, and coastal and
marine geographic information system data may be acquired from non-federal, industry data
sources and sets. Analytic approaches may include descriptive and inferential statistics and
advanced data mining and analytics. Third-party research support is not anticipated.
Evidence Use and Dissemination
Understanding historical fishing activities and landings of federally managed fisheries enables
DHS to direct its limited at-sea air and marine patrol assets to where they are most needed to
catch violators and protect natural resources. In addition, the question could inform other
organizations that establish fisheries regulations and management plans based on best available
fisheries science. Evidence building may engage or be used by USCG Maritime Law Enforcement,
NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service, NOAA Office of Law Enforcement, Regional Fisheries
Management Councils, SLTT fish and wildlife agencies, and other fishing management
organizations. Disclosure of data and some findings will be limited to U.S. Government.
Strategic Goal 5. Strengthen Preparedness and Resilience
G5-Q1 How do individuals' preparedness behaviors change over time?
DHS Strategic Objective: 5.1 Build a National Culture of Preparedness
Timing of Activities: FY 2022-2026
Strategy or Operation Background
The prevalence of disaster declarations and recovery costs over the last decade demonstrate the
need for everyone-at the individual, community, SLTT and federal levels-to improve their
preparedness for predictable natural events. DHS conducts research on preparedness, such as
the National Household Survey (NHS), and uses that research to inform awareness initiatives that
encourage the public to take steps to prepare. Annually DHS fields, analyzes, and publishes
statistics from the NHS, which includes a nationally representative sample of 5,000-7,000
30
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
FY 2022-2026 Learning Agenda
individuals' self-perceptions of their own preparedness with respect to a stages of change model.
Findings from this research, including how preparedness changes over time, enable DHS to
identify strategies to craft preparedness messaging aimed at improving public awareness and
self-efficacy, and motivating preparedness behavior change. Yet, more research is needed to
understand preparedness of individuals from historically underserved communities.21
Evidence Building
Foundational Fact Finding involves annual statistical analysis of nationally representative
quantitative survey research data on individuals' preparedness based on the stages of change
model, including new data on individuals of nine historically underserved communities starting
in FY 2022. As part of this effort, FEMA will pilot online, self-administered surveys and conduct
analysis on survey results, response rates, and other indicators of response quality compared
with interviewer-mediated telephone surveys to determine how to field the survey in future
years. Qualitative behavioral research, consisting of cognitive interviews and focus groups with a
subset of the survey sample, will examine what messages motivate preparedness behaviors
based on individuals' preparedness stage. Analytic approaches may include descriptive and
inferential statistics and qualitative data analysis. Third party research support is anticipated.
Evidence Use and Dissemination
Understanding diverse individuals' stages of preparedness, how preparedness behaviors change
over time, and which messages motivate individuals based on their preparedness stage is critical
for identifying gaps in the DHS/national strategy for preparedness, informing specific awareness
programs, and targeting messaging to individuals and communities in ways that promote equity
in preparedness. Evidence building may engage or be used by FEMA Individual and Community
Preparedness Division, FEMA regional offices, SLTT partners, and other federal and non-
government entities that support or study risk mitigation initiatives.

Strategy or Operation Background
DHS provides grants to SLTT governments that support preparation for threats and hazards
that pose the greatest risk to the security of the United States, including catastrophic events
at the nexus of preventing, preparing for, protecting against, and responding to
terrorism. Through its investments, DHS endeavors to identify promising practices and build
the evidence upon which grant program decisions are made. Previously, DHS conducted
pilot studies and an outcome evaluation to test methods of determining the investment
benefits of the Homeland Security Grant Program (HSGP) without requisite data. Additionally,
in FY 2020 DHS solicited information from stakeholders through a public Request for
Information to identify other existing data and evidence for HSGP's influence on SLTT
preparedness outcomes.

G5-Q6 To what extent were COVID Public Assistance obligations align with areas of social
vulnerability and high case rates in socially vulnerable areas?
DHS Strategic Objective: 5.3 Support Outcome-Driven Community Recovery
Timing of Activities: FY 2022-2026
Strategy or Operation Background
The COVID-19 pandemic created widespread need for state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT)
government entities and certain nonprofit organizations to undertake emergency measures that
addressed the evolving public threats of COVID-19. Socially vulnerable counties, including
counties in less urban areas and with higher percentages of racial and ethnic minority residents
and people living in crowded housing conditions, had persistently high COVID-19 incidence.
Under the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2021 and the
American Rescue Plan Act (ARP) of 2021, DHS provides funding for COVID-19 relief to ease some
of the financial stress and burden caused by the virus. This funding supports, among other things,
medical care, purchase and distribution of food and certain supplies, non-congregate medical
sheltering, and operation of emergency operations centers. The Administration and DHS are
committed to equitable delivery of assistance to support the resilience of socially vulnerable
communities.
Evidence Building
Program Evaluation includes outcome evaluation to understand the extent of COVID-19 Public
Assistance obligations to areas of social vulnerability and high case rates in those areas, the range

Goal 6: Champion the DHS Workforce and Strengthen the Department
G6-Q1 Does level of Independent Test Agent (ITA) support throughout the acquisition
lifecycle correlate with the adequacy of an acquisition program's test and evaluation
outputs (operational effectiveness, suitability, and resilience)?
DHS Strategic Objective: 6.1 Strengthen Departmental Governance and Management
Timing of Activities: FY 2023-2026
Strategy or Operation Background
Major acquisition programs are susceptible to programmatic, financial, schedule, technical, and
operational risks. In 2017, DHS implemented the Independent Test Agent (ITA) initiative, in which
ITAs are assigned to lead a series of "test and evaluation" (T&E) activities throughout each major
acquisition's life cycle. The test and evaluation activities focus on measuring progress of solution
development, and the effectiveness, suitability, and resilience of the developed solutions. These
measurements are intended to reduce acquisition risks and improve the likelihood of positive
acquisition outcomes, such as cost, schedule, and performance.
Evidence Building
Program Evaluation includes non-experimental outcome evaluation to examine the quantitative
correlation and the strength of the relationship between implemented levels of ITA support and
the T&E outputs, specifically, "adequacy" of major acquisition programs' T&E. In this context,
adequacy is the determination that the T&E conducted was of sufficient rigor and objectivity to
provide acquisition program leadership with a valid, reliable analysis of the status of the
acquisition product. A comparative qualitative case study design may complement the
quantitative outcome evaluation by examining how and why outcomes were achieved and other
context factors that influence ITA implementation and acquisition outcomes.

descriptive and inferential statistics for quantitative data, qualitative data analysis, and case
study analysis. Third party research support is not anticipated.
Evidence Use and Dissemination
Understanding whether and how ITA participation across the acquisition life cycle correlates with
the adequacy of test and evaluation to inform acquisition outcomes will inform allocation of
resources and other improvements to ITA implementation across DHS. Evidence building may
engage or be used by the S&T Test & Evaluation Division, the DHS Office of the Chief Acquisition
Officer, Component Acquisition Executive Offices, the DHS Joint Requirements Council, the DHS
Program Accountability and Risk Management Office, and ITAs.
G6-Q2 What are the estimated costs and benefits of DHS vehicle fleet electrification given
specialized/law enforcement requirements?
DHS Strategic Objective: 6.3 Optimize Support to Mission Operations
Timing of Activities: FY 2022-2023
Strategy or Operation Background
Section 205 "Federal Clean Electricity and Vehicle Procurement Strategy" of the Executive Order
14009 of January 27, 2021, Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad,22 calls for clean and
zero-emission vehicles for federal and SLTT government fleets. DHS is developing a 10-year plan
to electrify a portion of the Department's vehicle fleet and must consider goals, strategies, and
performance measures for its motor vehicle fleet, fuel procurement, and related sustainability
and environmental programs. Motor vehicle fleet electrification is intended to improve
sustainability and reduce environmental impact; however, the full extent of the costs and
benefits of this policy are currently unknown, especially for vehicles that must meet specialized
law enforcement requirements.

the President, 2021)
38
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
FY 2022-2026 Learning Agenda
Evidence Building
Policy Analysis includes formative economic analysis, specifically benefit-cost analysis, of fleet
vehicle electrification as an alternative to combustion vehicles, including costs of ownership,
petroleum fuel use, hazardous waste disposal, building/facility energy efficiency, and disposal
requirements for vehicles that meet specialized law enforcement requirements. Market research
will be conducted as needed to estimate total cost of ownership, determine charging
requirements, and understand hazardous waste and vehicle disposal for electric vehicles that
meet specialized law enforcement requirements.
Critical data sets include the Department's Asset Management Data Warehouse, Consolidated
Asset Portfolio, and Sustainability Information System and the General Services Administration
Federal Automotive Statistical Tool. These data include information on DHS combustion engine
motor vehicle fleet characteristics, cost of ownership, petroleum fuel use, and building energy
efficiency. New data to collect or acquire from industry or federal research and reports may
include the estimated total cost of ownership, hazardous waste and vehicle disposal
requirements, specialized/law enforcement requirements for vehicles, and charging
requirements. Analytic approaches may include descriptive and inferential statistics, benefit-cost
analysis, and qualitative data analysis. Third party research support is anticipated.
Evidence Use and Dissemination
Understanding the costs and benefits of DHS vehicle fleet electrification will enable DHS to
determine long-term bulk fuel requirements; identify strategies to offset impacts of vehicle fleet
electrification on building energy use; and set goals, strategy and performance measures for both
fleet electrification and building/facility sustainability. Evidence building may engage or be used
by DHS Office of the Chief Readiness Officer's Assets and Logistics and Sustainability and
Environmental Programs, DHS Components' Motor Vehicles and Sustainability and
Environmental Programs, General Services Administration, Council on Environmental Quality,
Department of Energy Federal Energy Management Program, other federal agencies affected by
the order, and vehicle and charging station manufacturers.
G6-Q3 What effects has the adoption of maximum telework flexibilities had on the DHS
mission and support for the DHS mission? What subgroups of the DHS workforce
benefit the most/least from telework flexibilities?
DHS Strategic Objective: 6.3 Optimize Support to Mission Operations
Timing of Activities: FY 2022-2025
39
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
FY 2022-2026 Learning Agenda
Strategy or Operation Background
The Telework Enhancement Act of 20102ยณ calls for federal agencies to establish and implement a
policy under which employees shall be authorized to telework. The arrival of the COVID-19
pandemic ushered in a new reality for DHS work, workforce, and workplace with the adoption of
maximum telework flexibilities. Adopting this policy ensured continuity of DHS operations and
operations support with maximal workforce safety; however, the full extent of the costs and
effects of this policy are currently unknown.
Much of DHS' mission must be carried out in person or on site. Approximately 65 percent of the
Department's employees work in such an environment, including TSA screeners, Customs and
Border Protection officers, Border Patrol agents, ICE Detention and Removal officers, Homeland
Security Investigations special agents, and U.S. Secret Service special agents. Examining the
effects of the Telework Enhancement Act Policy and expanding telework flexibilities should not
be done in a vacuum, and DHS must take into consideration a Component's mission, its workforce
populations, occupation series, and whether an employee is in a DHS-specific Priority Mission
Critical Occupation (PMCO). The Departments PMCOs are those occupations that most directly
affect mission achievement and are identified as having the greatest impact to the Department's
goals and objectives, such as FEMA Emergency Management specialists, ICE Homeland Security
Investigations criminal investigators, ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations deportation
officers, and USSS Uniformed Division officers and special agents.
Evidence Building
Program Evaluation may include non-experimental outcome evaluation or quasi-experimental
impact evaluation to understand the effects of maximum telework flexibilities on DHS work,
workforce, and workplace, considering how effects varied by subgroups, such as organization
and job series. Evaluation may include process evaluation questions to explore enablers, barriers,
and unintended consequences of participating in telework. Prior to evaluation, an evaluability
assessment will be conducted to identify key evaluation questions and determine the most
suitable approach for evaluating the program.
Existing data may include information technology and real property costs from financial/cost data
available from the Future Years Homeland Security Program and Real Property Capital data;
organization and workforce telework participation from administrative/operational data;
employee COVID-19/telework experience, engagement, and satisfaction from the 2020 and 2021
Federal Employee Viewpoint and the 2020 Federal Managers Surveys; human capital and
operational performance data and reports from aggregate personnel performance data and DHS
Annual Performance Plans and Reports, Quarterly Performance Reviews, and Strategic Reviews.
New data to collect through quantitative surveys or qualitative interviews/focus groups with the
DHS workforce include enablers, barriers, and unintended consequences of participating in
23 Public Law (P.L.) 111-292 (2010)
40
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
FY 2022-2026 Learning Agenda
telework. Analytic approaches may include descriptive and inferential statistics and qualitative
data analysis. Third party research support is anticipated.
Evidence Use and Dissemination
Understanding the quantitative and qualitative effects of maximum telework flexibilities on DHS
work, workforce, and workplace during the pandemic will enable DHS to refine telework, physical
infrastructure, and human capital strategies, policies, and agency performance measures.
Evidence building may engage or be used by the Offices of the DHS Chief Readiness Support,
Information, Procurement, Human Capital, Security and Financial Officers. The equivalent
Component-level offices will also support data collection and subsequent policy formulation and
implementation. External stakeholders such as the Office of Personnel Management, OMB, and
the Government Accountability Office would also benefit from the data, information, and insights
gained from the telework policy evaluation.
G6-Q4 What effects has adoption of a standard utilization rate (UR) of 150 sq. ft./person had
on the Department's real property footprint? What factors support and hinder
implementation of the 150 sq. ft./person standard?
DHS Strategic Objective: 6.3 Optimize Support to Mission Operations
Timing of Activities: FY 2022-2023
Strategy or Operation Background
The Department's real property portfolio accounts for about $7.5 Billion of the Department's
annual spending. In 2015, DHS adopted a standard utilization rate (UR) of 150 sq. ft./person for
the Department's real property portfolio based on number of "assigned" full time equivalents (a
metric that equates total labor hours to full-time employees). The intended result of adopting a
standard UR is to right-size the Department's real estate for its workforce while minimizing
underused facilities. The effect on the Department's real estate footprint has been slow and
uneven due to (1) reductions occurring primarily when long lease terms expire, which creates
opportunities for co-location and consolidations of space, and (2) Congressionally mandated
programs and statutory mission requirements across the Department that drive growth,
offsetting these reductions. The Department aims to revise this standard using new methods that
account for alternative work arrangements, such as telework and remote work. Multiple
initiatives are currently underway to gather better information on utilization and space
programming requirements.
Evidence Building
Program Evaluation includes non-experimental outcome evaluation to determine effects of the
UR standard on the Department's real property footprint and other unintended consequences.
Additionally, the evaluation will examine FY 15-FY 20 costs, feasibility, and acceptability, including
enablers and barriers, of implementing the UR standard. The study design must account for
41
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
FY 2022-2026 Learning Agenda
partial applicability of the standard to administrative spaces only, co-mingling of administrative
and mission spaces resulting in implementation of higher mission space utilization rates, key
context factors that limit adoption (e.g., expiration of long lease terms), and long returns
on investment. Prior to evaluation, an evaluability assessment will be conducted to
identify key evaluation questions and determine the most suitable approach for evaluating the
program.
Existing administrative/operational data include information on costs, utilization, occupancy, and
workforce location (e.g., from IT network access, physical access, and self-reported workforce
location data). New data to acquire includes DHS employee workplace satisfaction from the U.S.
General Services Administration (GSA) Tenant Satisfaction Surveys. In addition, the evaluation
will collect workforce perspectives on enablers, barriers, and unintended effects of implementing
the UR standard through DHS-specific quantitative surveys and qualitative interviews/focus
groups. Analytic approaches may include descriptive and inferential statistics and qualitative data
analysis. Third party research support is anticipated.
Evidence Use and Dissemination
Understanding the implementation and effects of the current UR adoption rate as well as
enablers and barriers of adoption are critical to informing future UR standards, strategies that
reduce barriers to and enable implementation of UR standards, and performance goals for
adoption of UR standards. Evidence building may engage or be used by the DHS Office of the
Chief Readiness Officer Assets and Logistics and Real Property Programs, the Office of the Chief
Financial Officer, and Components' Chief Administrative Officers and Real Property Directors.
External federal partners include GSA, OMB, other agency stakeholders of the Federal Real
Property Council and Federal Facilities Council, and The House Committee on Transportation and
Infrastructure.
G6-Q5 What metrics/indicators can be used to reliably predict cost to maintain materiel
readiness requirements for deployed systems in CBP's stated five Enduring Mission
Priority Outcomes: Combating Transnational Organized Crime, Counter Terrorism,
Facilitate Lawful Travel, Secure the Border, and Facilitate Lawful Trade and Protect
Revenue?
DHS Strategic Objective: 6.3 Optimize Support to Mission Operations
Timing of Activities: FY 2022-2026
Strategy or Operation Background
Secure, well-managed borders are needed to protect the U.S. against threats from abroad and to
safeguard and expedite the flow of lawful trade and travel. A modernized and efficient border
management mission requires a combination of trained workforce and operational materiel
(technology, systems, assets) that are deployed at and between designated ports of entry along
the U.S. land and coastal borders. Operational readiness of materiel must enable the trained
42
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
FY 2022-2026 Learning Agenda
workforce to successfully meet the strategic, operational, and tactical requirements of the DHS
border management mission. Optimizing the materiel's reliability and the materiel's supply chain
downtime performance outcomes provide for the most cost-efficient materiel readiness.
Evidence Building
Performance Measurement includes performance measures/dashboards development and
annual/semi-annual review processes to assess and track performance outcome indicators for
availability, reliability, downtime, and ownership cost of materiel against known requirements
for 43 individual programs of record and four broader enterprise cross-cutting materiel portfolios
(as of February 2022).
Existing administrative/operational data include information on baseline status and user
requirements for program- or portfolio-specific materiel availability, reliability, downtime, and
cost indicators. In the future, administrative/operational data will also support mission-driven
updates to materiel readiness outcome requirements, informed by evolving threats, technology
capabilities, maintenance improvements, and operating plans.
Analytic approaches such as activity/flow modeling and failure modes and effects analysis may
be used to predict readiness needs and associated cost drivers. This project anticipates deploying
an agency-wide Asset Management Tool and a custom dashboard that monitors current status,
tracks progress toward achieving outcome requirements, and provides predictive ability for
decision makers to prioritize budgets against materiel life cycle readiness requirements. Third
party research support is anticipated.
Evidence Use and Dissemination
Establishing outcome measures for achieving and sustaining materiel life cycle readiness
requirements at best cost and understanding shortfalls in meeting those requirements can
inform the alignment of resources needed to address those shortfalls. Tracking progress toward
outcome measures provides the discipline and data-driven analytical rigor needed for executive
level decision making confidence. Evidence building will engage external stakeholders such as the
Department of Defense, Department of Energy, Government Accountability Office, DHS
Inspector General, and industry partners. Evidence users include DHS Deputy Undersecretary for
Management, DHS Joint Requirements Council, DHS Chief Readiness Support Officer, CBP Deputy
Commissioner, six CBP Executive Assistant Commissioners, and seven CBP Portfolio Acquisition
Executives. Disclosure of findings will be limited to DHS.
DHS Data Priorities for Evidence Building
Reliable and relevant data are the foundation of all evidence building. DHS establishes and
manages a broad range of programs, policies, and regulations to ensure the security of the
Homeland. To know which of these is working well and to inform decision making, DHS must have
high quality data and contextual evidence. In this regard, data are strategic assets.
43
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
FY 2022-2026 Learning Agenda
The data identified in the preceding Study Plan section were selected to align with the evidence-
building objectives, research questions, and study designs described. Before embarking on
evidence building, DHS will examine existing data-of the Department, other Federal agencies,
SLTT and industry partners, the academic research community, and others-to determine
whether they are adequate to address a priority question. In cases where data are insufficient
for evidence building, DHS may collect or acquire new data.
The sections that follow describe multiple types of data assets and specific examples from DHS
Components and other data owners that were identified in the preceding study plans. These data
priorities will benefit from further collaboration with DHS, Component, and other federal
agencies' Chief Data Officers to ensure data quality, data access, and data information sharing
agreements are sufficient to enable evidence building. The Chief Privacy Officer, relevant
Component Privacy Officers, and the Chief Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Officer will support the
Department's compliance with relevant legal authorities and privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties
protections and the appropriate privacy compliance and other documentation required, such as
information sharing agreements, is in place, as appropriate.
Administrative and Operational Data Systems
DHS generates administrative and operational data in the conduct of its mission. These data are
an essential resource for many of the evidence-building activities described in this learning
agenda. For the purpose of this document, administrative/operational data' includes an array of
administrative, regulatory, law enforcement, adjudicatory, financial and other data held by DHS
to carry out the administration and operations related to its mission.
Several strengths of administrative/operational data make it valuable for evidence building,
including that it
offers comprehensive data on populations served and affected by DHS programs,
which supports a range of study designs and may contain information about
important but relatively rare events;
can have longitudinal structure that enables researchers to follow individuals over time
to address societally important questions with long-term horizons;
may be less likely to have high rates of nonresponse, attrition, and underreporting than
survey research and other voluntary data collection directly from individuals, groups, and
organizations; and
allows DHS to conduct in-house studies to examine its strategies and operations.
The following data systems and datasets that have been proposed for use in evidence building
are listed in Exhibit 3.

interactive visualizations from verified and validated administrative and operational data. These
data products support resource allocation, priorities setting, and planning for Departmental and
intergovernmental functions, as well as build evidence to support program operations. They are
publicly available for use by DHS partners and stakeholders. Statistical data and data compilations

DHS Survey and Assessment Data Assets
Preparedness surveys funded by DHS represent a crucial part of the nation's preparedness data
infrastructure. These surveys gather information from nationally representative samples or
panels of individuals to measure the public's degree of preparedness for hazards they are likely
to face; awareness, attitudes, and experiences that can motivate actions to prepare; successful
mechanisms for enhancing preparedness; and areas that need improvement.
DHS (FEMA) Child Safeguarding Guidelines do not allow data collection from children directly.
To mitigate this, DHS collects parents' and curriculum instructors' perceptions of the motivators
and barriers to youth preparedness, household preparedness and actions taken, age-
appropriate youth contributions, and perceived effectiveness of aspects of preparedness
programs on motivating youth preparedness.
46
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
FY 2022-2026 Learning Agenda
DHS also conducts numerous large-scale voluntary surveys of Federal, SLTT, and private sector
critical infrastructure sector operators to collect data that provide DHS and its SLTT and private
sector partners with operational awareness as to the readiness and risk resilience of these
systems.

Study Types, Data Collection Methods, Analytic Approaches for
Evidence Building
The Evidence Act requires learning agendas to include detailed methodologies for evidence
building. Here we describe the types of studies and efforts undertaken in foundational fact
finding, policy analysis, performance measurement, and program evaluation, as well as the
common methods of data collection and analytic approaches used in Department evidence
building. Since many data collection and analysis methods may trigger privacy compliance or
other compliance requirements, methodologies will be coordinated with relevant privacy
offices for privacy compliance and other compliance offices, as appropriate.
Study Types
This section describes common study types and efforts that are used in DHS foundational fact
finding, policy analysis, performance measurement, and program evaluation. Here we describe
the purpose and characteristics of study types. Each relies on a combination of data collection
methods and analysis approaches described in subsequent sections.
48
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
FY 2022-2026 Learning Agenda
Needs Assessment
DHS conducts needs assessments for formative purposes to systematically assess the needs of
its potential or actual customers and beneficiaries, examine the nature and causes of those
needs, set priorities for the future, and consider the approaches and resources required for
programs to achieve intended goals.
Evidence Reviews
DHS evidence reviews summarize the state of knowledge in a research area based on secondary
sources such as scholarly research publications and reports. Literature reviews include
substantive findings and theoretical and methodological contributions to a topic, and thus serve
as the foundation for many studies. Systematic reviews are a type of literature review that seek
to identify, appraise, and synthesize all research evidence on a given topic or question.
Statistical Analysis
Although methods and techniques of statistics are used across all evidence-building activities,
this learning agenda uses 'statistical analysis' to indicate when federal statistical data, federal
administrative/operational data, quantitative survey research data, or combinations of those, are
primarily used in quantitative measurements, calculations, models, classifications, and/or
sampling methods to describe, estimate, or predict one or more conditions, outcomes, variables,
or the relationships between them for groups (not individuals).
Economic Analysis or Evaluation
DHS uses theory-guided analytic methods of economics when results of interest are expressed in
terms of economic metrics such as costs, benefits, transfer payments, distributional impacts, and
return on investment. Common analysis includes break-even analysis, benefit-cost analysis, cost-
effectiveness analysis, economic consequence analysis, and economic impact analysis. Economic
analysis can be used for formative purposes to estimate future results and costs to achieve them
such as when conducting policy analysis or regulatory impact analysis to inform new policies and
regulations. Economic analysis can be used for summative purposes in evaluations to determine
actual results and costs, typically compared to alternatives approaches for programs, policies,
and regulations.
Performance Measures or Dashboard Development
Performance measures typically use administrative or operational data tabulated in specific ways
to support regular, periodic measurement of key indicators of performance in support of
progress monitoring and early intervention to improve operations, service delivery, and results.
Although DHS has a robust performance measurement system, learning agenda priority
questions that indicate performance measurement often intend to develop and deploy new
performance measures or dashboards that better enable use of performance information.
49
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
FY 2022-2026 Learning Agenda
Grant Performance Measurement
Grant performance measurement is a systematic way of tracking the characteristics and
performance of federal grants. Recent updates to Federal regulations24 require that Federal
agencies' grant performance measurement include agency-specified goals, indicators, targets,
baseline data, data collections, expected outcomes, and timelines for accomplishments. These
measures allow DHS to show achievement of program goals and objectives, evaluation the
effectiveness of grant programs, improve program outcomes, share lessons learned, and foster
adoption of promising practices.
Evaluability Assessment
Evaluability assessments are a systematic pre-evaluation examination of the extent to which a
program, policy, regulation, or organization can be evaluated in a reliable and credible fashion or
to which an evaluation is worthwhile based on the evaluation's likely benefits, costs, and
outcomes. It can help answer the questions, "Is the program and its parent organization ready
for evaluation," "What type of evaluation is most suitable to assess the program," and "What
changes are needed to increase readiness before an evaluation takes place?'
Formative Evaluation
Formative evaluation assesses whether a program, policy, regulation, or organization approach
(or some aspect of these) is feasible, appropriate, and acceptable before it is fully implemented.
It may include process and/or outcome measures. However, it focuses on learning and
improvement and does not aim to answer questions of overall effectiveness. It can help answer
the questions, "Is the program, policy, regulation, or organization appropriate for this context,"
"Does it feasibly address the identified needs," and "Can it be implemented as designed?"
Although there are no current learning agenda questions that intend to use formative
evaluations, we anticipate conducting formative evaluation in studies that are added to the
learning agenda in the future.
Process/Implementation Evaluation
Process/implementation evaluation assesses the extent to which essential elements of a
program, policy, regulation, or operation are in place; conform to requirements, program design,
professional standards, or customer expectations; and are capable of delivering positive
outcomes. It can help answer the questions, "Was the program, policy, regulation, or
organization implemented as intended?" or "How is it operating in practice?" In the learning
agenda, several evaluations study process-related questions to understand underlying
mechanisms of outcomes achievement.
Outcome Evaluation
Outcome evaluation assesses the extent to which a program, policy, regulation, or operation has
achieved certain objectives, and how it achieved these objectives. Outcome evaluations use non-
experimental designs characterized by the absence of a control or comparison group. Unlike
24 2 CFR ยง 200.301, Performance Measurement (2021)
50
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
FY 2022-2026 Learning Agenda
impact evaluation, outcome evaluation cannot discern that outcomes result from or are a causal
effect of the program. It can help answer the question "Were the intended outcomes achieved?"
Impact Evaluation
Impact evaluation assesses the causal effect or impact of an implemented program, policy,
regulation, or operation on outcomes by estimating what would have happened in its absence.
This estimation requires the use of experimental (or randomized control trial, RCT) designs or
quasi-experimental designs (QED) in which another group is compared to program participants.
Experimental/RCT designs randomly assign (e.g., lottery draw) persons to either a treatment
group that receives the program or policy intervention or to a control group that does not. Quasi-
experimental groups identify a program or policy intervention group and comparison group from
pre-existing or self-selected groups (not through random assignment). Impact evaluation can
help answer the question, "Does the program, policy, regulation, or organization work, or did it
lead to the observed outcomes?"
Behaviorally Informed Innovation
This quantitative method uses a behavioral intervention such as a nudge, default choice, or
availability of clear and relevant information, that is studied within a randomized control trial or
quasi-experimental study design to determine and quantify the intervention's effectiveness in
encouraging positive, helpful decisions and behaviors. Although there are no current learning
agenda questions that use behaviorally informed innovation, we anticipate use of this
aspirational evidence building in future amendments of the learning agenda.
Data Collection Methods
Data collection methods are the techniques used to gather the information needed to answer
the priority questions. When selecting methods for data collection, DHS considers which method
is
more likely to secure the information needed;
more appropriate given who is being asked to provide the information;
least disruptive to the program and target populations; and
most feasible given the available resources.
Common methods DHS uses to collect information directly from people for the primary purpose
of evidence building include quantitative surveys, qualitative interviews and focus groups, and
observations. DHS uses other methods such as open or public use data access, restricted use
data licensing, and data sharing agreements for acquiring existing data sets from non-DHS
sources. These methods are described below.
Quantitative Surveys
Surveys are predetermined sets of questions, often with set response options, administered to
samples or panels of respondents to cost-effectively compile statistical information about
51
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
FY 2022-2026 Learning Agenda
individuals, households, and organizations. DHS uses surveys in different ways. DHS uses surveys
to track variables of longer-term interest, as well as to obtain reliable information about
conditions through shorter-term studies. DHS conducts low-burden customer satisfaction
surveys to gather near real-time impressions of customers' touchpoint(s) or transaction(s) with
a government service in terms of trust, overall satisfaction, and experience drivers (e.g., service
quality, process, and people, when applicable). DHS also uses surveys of participants in program
evaluations to determine their baseline conditions and subsequent outcomes.
Qualitative Interviews and Focus Groups
These qualitative data collections use primarily open-ended questions to converse with an
individual respondent or with a small group of respondents simultaneously to collect narrative
information about a subject, circumstance, or event. DHS uses this method across evidence-
building activities to understand the way people think, their motivation, and their attitudes
toward the topic or experience. Although qualitative interviews/focus groups cannot be used to
infer causality or to measure effectiveness, they are often valuable tools for theory building and
developing awareness of factors that affect outcomes. As such they often complement other
evidence building such as surveys, economic analysis, and different types of program evaluation.
Observation
Observation is an immersive qualitative method for collecting data about people, processes, and
cultures, but may be entirely or partially structured (quantitative) or unstructured (qualitative).
Structured observations systematically classify behaviors into distinct categories to describe
a
characteristic or use of a scale to measure behavior intensity. Unstructured observation records
all relevant behavior without a system of categorization.
Open or public use data access
Open data is freely available, easily discoverable and accessible, and published in ways that allow
it to be used by people other than those that originally collected the data. Public-use data is the
name often used for Federal statistical survey data that have been anonymized with the
individually identifiable information having been recoded or deleted to protect the
confidentiality of the survey respondents. DHS uses open or public use data access as one means
of acquiring existing data that may be relevant to evidence building.
Restricted Use Data Licensing and Data Linkage
Restricted use data licensing is a mechanism for making more detailed data available to qualified
researchers. Restricted-use data have a higher level of detail in the data compared to public-use
data files. These data typically contain subject data, or individually identifiable information about
respondents. DHS may use restricted use data licensing to access other Federal statistical and
administrative data for linkage to DHS administrative/operational data. Data linkage means that
records from two or more datasets that refer to the same entity are joined. DHS uses this
technique to fill important data gaps needed to answer DHS questions that require individual,

household, or community demographics and socioeconomic characteristics that DHS does not
collect.
Data Sharing Agreements
DHS establishes data sharing agreements when data are being shared across organizations. The
agreements typically establish authority, provisions for acceptable data use, confidentiality and
other conditions for subsequent release of information, and time limits. DHS increasingly uses
data sharing agreements with partner agencies to avoid duplicative collections of mission critical
data and to leverage its partners' data collection authorities and assets that are distinct from but
relevant to the Department.
Analytic Approaches
Analytic approaches are the techniques used to characterize and understand the interrelations
of information and data to answer the priority questions. Analysis is broad in scope, but the
following analytic approaches are commonly used at DHS.
Descriptive Statistics
Nearly all DHS evidence building uses methods to tabulate summary statistics that characterize
cases in a sample data set. Descriptive statistics often focus on quantifying the proportions of
various characteristics, major subgroups in the sample, and the shape of the distribution.
Inferential Statistics
Some DHS learning agenda studies use inferential statistics to draw conclusions that extend
beyond simply summarizing the characteristics of the immediate data. Inferential statistics may
specify under what circumstances a sample represents a broader population. Inferential statistics
may also be used to identify statistical relationships by testing hypotheses to determine if
differences between two or more groups, changes over time, or associations between two or
more variables are not likely to occur randomly. Regression models are a common type of
inferential statistical analysis used to identify and understand relationships between variables of
interest, such as to infer how much of an outcome measure is explained by program participation
or other factors of interest.
Advanced Data Mining and Analytics
DHS uses artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques applied to structured and/or
unstructured data (such as content in natural language text) to detect and visualize hidden
patterns in large datasets or use algorithms to build predictive and prescriptive models that allow
problems to be anticipated and addressed proactively.
Network Analysis
Network analysis is a specific advanced data analytic method that includes techniques for
collection, statistical analysis, and visualization of input data-typically from designed surveys or
from communication and collaboration systems data-to quantitatively and qualitatively
53
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
FY 2022-2026 Learning Agenda
characterize patterns in a whole system of relationships and parts of a network, such as people
or groups of an organization or community. Network analysis can help us to understand the
strength, frequency, and nature of interactions, including flows of information, resources, and
work.
Benefit-Cost, Cost Effectiveness, and Break-Even Analysis
These methods are common in DHS economic analysis and evaluation for programs, policies, and
regulations. Benefit-cost analysis aims to identify and compare relevant quantitative and
qualitative costs and benefits associated with an activity, usually expressed in monetary terms.
Cost effectiveness analysis estimates the cost of achieving a single goal, nonmonetary outcome,
or objective, which can be used to identify the least costly alternatives for meeting that goal.
Break-even analysis identifies the point at which estimated total costs and total gains are equal-
that is, it answers the question, "How small could the value of the non-quantified benefits be (or
how large would the value of non-quantified costs need to be) before the rule would yield zero
net benefits?"
Qualitative Data Analysis
Qualitative data analysis uses a flexible set of approaches to examine patterns in communicated
information. Content analysis may focus on the presence and frequency of concepts-typically
words, phrases, or images- - or show how concepts are related to each other and the context in
which they exist. Thematic framework analysis identifies patterns of meaning, or themes.
Themes may be determined deductively (themes selected from existing research or theory) or
inductively (themes built from the data) to develop patterns. The analysis may examine explicit
content of data or examine subtext or assumptions from the data. DHS uses qualitative data
analysis when analyzing different kind of textual secondary data and data from interviews/focus
groups and observations.
Case Studies
A case study provides an in-depth, qualitative analysis of a single subject or small group of
subjects, such as an individual, group (e.g., organization, community, or "site"). or event. The
analysis integrates data collected through several methods, such as quantitative surveys,
qualitative interviews/focus groups, and observations and documents, to draw conclusions only
about the studied subject(s) and within the given context. Although case studies cannot be used
to infer causation or to measure effectiveness in achieving outcomes, they are often valuable for
building theory and developing awareness of factors that affect outcomes.
Challenges and Mitigating Strategies for Evidence Building
Although each learning agenda priority question may be subject to a unique combination of
challenges and mitigating strategies, some of which are discussed in Strategy or Operation
Background sections, there are also a number of common challenges and recommended
mitigating strategies that we describe in the sections that follow.
54
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
FY 2022-2026 Learning Agenda
Common Challenges
Complexity of coordinating evidence building
DHS has a complex mission and evidence building often requires coordination of knowledge,
expertise, and effort that span organizations, subject matter, technical, data, and analytic silos.
In addition, some Department evidence building relies on the data it collects from or shared by
Federal, SLTT, industry, and other partners.
Gaps in data access or quality
Gaps in sufficiently detailed, accurate, and complete data, or lack of existing data or lack of
measures for all relevant indicators to answer a question are common in evidence building. Such
gaps result for many reasons. Most common is that legacy data collections were initially designed
to support operations not specific evidence-building activities or indicators, like equity. Some
data may not be collected, or when collected, they may have high non-response or restrictions
on use. In some cases, gaps can be mitigated by updating System of Record Notices (SORNs) to
allow data to be used for evidence building. Often, gaps in data access or quality often require
new collections or revisions to existing data collections. The Paperwork Reduction Act requires
federal agencies to obtain approval for such information collections from the Office of
Management and Budget, which generally consists of a public comment period and OMB review
of the survey instrument to be administered to more than nine respondents. This process can
also introduce substantial delays of data collection efforts.
Evaluability of strategies or operations
To evaluate whether a strategy (program, policy, regulation, or some combination of them) or
operation achieves its outcomes it must be evaluable-that is, we must clarify what the desired
outcomes are, how activities are logically linked to those outcomes, and what indicators and
measures provide data to assess them. DHS programs are complex constellations of activities
that may be conducted through multiple touchpoints over time and in different settings and
locations. Among the more challenging cases of evaluability, grant programs do not prescribe an
activity; rather these programs provide grantees discretion to pursue many eligible activities that
collectively contribute to the achievement of program outcomes.
Insufficient or variable resources for evidence building
The DHS Capacity Assessment indicates inconsistent and relatively low levels of resources set
aside for evidence building, especially program evaluation and other evaluation-related
activities. Few Components have set aside budgets to support independent, third-party research,
analysis, and evaluation. Furthermore, the DHS Capacity Assessment indicates there is uneven
staffing and expertise available to design and conduct scientifically rigorous internal studies or to
architect procurement requirements and external expert teams that will yield high quality study
designs and results.
55
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
FY 2022-2026 Learning Agenda
Lag time for rigorous evaluation
Carefully structured evaluations can require considerable resources and multiple years to design
and complete. In some cases, sustained intervention and measurement over many years is
needed to produce and assess effectiveness in achieving mid-and long-term outcomes or societal
impacts. In other cases lengthy internal and OMB approval processes for direct data collection
efforts delay data collection. The lag time to results is a key criticism of the utility of evaluation
at DHS and requires exploration of creative solutions, including solutions that reduce barriers to
direct data collections that are vital to evaluation and using study designs with administrative
data that will allow for low-cost, timely evaluations where possible.
Constraints on methods
Randomized control trials and quasi-experimental designs that also study comparison groups are
often not feasible for DHS programs and policies. Furthermore, the Department's recent capacity
assessment suggests DHS makes limited use of more advanced quantitative methods, such as
inferential statistics, time series, and economic analysis. Thus, evaluative questions about
"effects", "impacts" and "effectiveness" of DHS programs, policies, and regulations may be
difficult to answer with definitive statements about causality or attribution.
Pandemic, disaster, and other emergent interruptions
Ongoing government response to pandemic, disasters, and other emergent issues (e.g., mass
migration, cybersecurity threats) can result in shifts in government operations and workforce
appropriately to address them, which sometimes interferes with planned evidence-building
activities.
Mitigating Strategies
In-house and interagency research collaborations
A number of proposals are envisioned as in-house research, including within- and between-
Component collaboration for data integration and/or analysis. In-house research collaborations
can be facilitated through coordination among existing DHS councils, communities of practice,
and working groups. For example, the DHS Evaluation Officer Council, Data Governance Council,
Performance Improvement Community of Practice, Agency Equity Working Group, and multiple
communities of interest (e.g., operations research, modeling and simulation, and artificial
intelligence/machine learning) can advance cross-cutting evidence building.
Other questions pose opportunities for mutually beneficial interagency research collaborations.
For these questions, the Department can leverage existing interagency councils and working
groups, such as the National Security Council, CFO Act Evaluation Officers' Council and Data
Governance Council, the Interagency Council on Statistical Policy, or other topic-specific groups
that support interagency collaboration.
56
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
FY 2022-2026 Learning Agenda
Engaging external expertise
The DHS Science & Technology Directorate has existing contracts, grants, and other agreements
to support the DHS research and development enterprise. These partnerships with academic
institutions (e.g., Centers of Excellence, Technology Centers), private sector (e.g., Federally
Funded Research and Development Centers), National Laboratories, and other federal agencies
can provide a source of expertise for technical consultations to study design or for the conduct
of studies that address learning agenda priorities. In addition, The DHS Joint Duty Program and
government-wide Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPA) Mobility Programs enable feasible and
convenient exchange of skilled personnel between government and non-government
institutions, respectively.
Data governance and enterprise data management
Aligning data ownership, authorities, responsibilities, and resources with identified data priorities
has the potential to pose challenges across the Department. The DHS Chief Data Officer supports
collaboration across Components and data domains. Over time, the learning agenda will benefit
from ongoing efforts to establish domain-specific data standards and governance, establish a
comprehensive DHS data inventory, and improve data access and governance for evidence
building across the enterprise.
Ongoing efforts to improve data sharing
The DHS Chief Data Officer's Data Sharing Agreements Working Group is working to establish and
implement unified policy, procedures, samples, and ongoing technical assistance for data sharing
with DHS partners. Generally, these efforts aim to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of
data sharing efforts, and the learning agenda may indicate what data sharing agreements may
be priorities to ensure data are available for evidence building as planned.
Using and linking other federal agency and statistical data
Using and linking DHS administrative data with other federal agency and statistical data (e.g., U.S.
Census data and American Household Survey data) may be a cost-effective strategy for filling
important data gaps needed to answer questions, such as those relating to individual, household,
or community demographics and socioeconomic characteristics that DHS does not collect.
Evaluability assessment
Evaluability assessments can help determine whether programs are ready for meaningful
evaluation and whether an evaluation is likely to provide useful information. Evaluability
assessments analyze and draw conclusions about program design, implementation, operating
context, existing measures, and data. They recommend appropriate evaluation designs and
programmatic improvements that are needed before conducting the evaluation. The DHS
Evaluation Officer encourages evaluability assessments be conducted by a qualified third-party
evaluator when no prior evaluations have been conducted and as tool for building program and
organizational evaluation capacity.
57
U.S. Department of Homeland Security
FY 2022-2026 Learning Agenda
Ongoing efforts to improve grant performance measurement
Across DHS, concerted effort is underway to improve grant performance measurement in
response to recent regulatory requirements for the administration of federal awards25 These
changes have included calls to articulate program theory or logic frameworks, identify outcome
indicators and measures for tracking grants' contributions to program goals and objectives, and
establish other valid and reliable measures of cost-effectiveness for these portfolios. These
improvements will enable results-oriented grant management and ensure valuable data that can
be harnessed for program management, reporting to stakeholders, and program evaluation.
Ongoing efforts to measure and advance equity
Executive Order 13985 created an unparalleled opportunity to consider data assets that are
needed to disaggregate analysis by race, ethnicity, gender, disability, income, veteran status, and
other key demographic characteristics describing underserved communities as well as a broader
range of data collection methods to help us better understand barriers that affect underserved
communities' access to, participation in, and outcomes of DHS services, benefits, and
opportunities.
Financing the learning agenda
The DHS Evaluation Officer's funding for evaluation and evidence building can provide a small
source of funds for securing external expertise for addressing learning agenda priorities. The DHS
Evaluation Officer will prioritize evaluation and evaluation-related activities (e.g., needs
assessments, evaluability assessments, capacity building efforts) but may co-sponsor select non-
evaluation projects that have the potential to improve a program's readiness for future
evaluation. It will not be feasible for DHS to address all priority questions in the learning agenda
without strong commitment of Components to fund and manage studies for learning priorities
that are most relevant to their missions. It is OMB's expectation that Components use direct
appropriations and authorities to use a portion of program or activity funds for third-party
evaluation or other evidence-building activities.
Assessing and increasing evidence-building capacity
The Evidence Act's requirements to assess the Department's capacity to plan, build, and use
evidence to strengthen policy and practice have the potential to strongly complement the
strategic evidence-building direction of a learning agenda by describing the foundation and
needed enhancements for effectively using the evidence. The capacity assessment will help the
Department senior officials to determine where new or different investment of resources are
needed to ensure evidence building described in the Department's learning agendas and annual
evaluation plans is successful. It is OMB's expectation that Components will hire or develop
dedicated staff with the necessary skills to carry out technical evaluation or other evidence-
building activities.

Proliferation of learning agendas and annual evaluation plans
Some DHS organizations and programs are in the process of establishing their own learning
agenda and annual evaluation plans to identify, prioritize, and coordinate a more comprehensive
set of evidence-building activities to support local decision-making over time. As learning
agendas and evaluation plans proliferate across the Department, more evidence about the
context, delivery, and outcomes of the DHS mission will be available to support organizational
learning, strategic and program management, performance improvement, and accountability to
the public.
