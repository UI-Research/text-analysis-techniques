Officer's Message
On behalf of the evaluation community at the U.S. Department of Labor, I am pleased
to share the Evaluation Plan for Fiscal Years 2022-2023. This 2-year plan reflects
our ongoing commitment to building new, scientific knowledge about opportunities to
improve lives and conditions for workers in the U.S. and internationally. As the economy
changes, so too do the demands for learning about effectiveness of new and existing
policies, programs, and practices.
The evaluation and research activities described in this report forecast to specific
commitments of the department but are not exhaustive of the evidence-building agenda.
We continuously seek out new learning opportunities and invite you to reflect on the
current plan and share ideas for future topics, methods, and approaches.
Thank you for your partnership as we continue to build the evidence base.

CHIEF EVALUATION OFFICER'S MESSAGE
TAT
EVALUATION PLAN
Summary
The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) is
committed to making evidence-informed
decisions to support America's workers.
To bolster these efforts, on an annual
basis, DOL's Chief Evaluation Office (CEO)
develops an Evaluation Plan to target
evaluation resources on areas of strategic
importance. The Evaluation Plan for Fiscal
Years 2022-2023 (DOL Evaluation Plan)
describes significant evaluation activities
that CEO will undertake before the end of
Fiscal Year 2023. It does not include all
of DOL's evaluation efforts, and DOL may
identify additional significant evaluations
during this time period.
The evaluation and research activities
outlined in this document apply the
most rigorous methods possible and will
generate evidence to inform policymaking
decisions across DOL and among other
federal decision-makers. Planned research
reflects the Department's Strategic
Plan priorities, statutory requirements
for evaluations, and priorities identified
by DOL sub-agencies in their learning
agendas that are best addressed through
program evaluation. This plan also fulfills
legislative mandates outlined in the Further
Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 and
in Title I of the Foundations for Evidence-
Based Policymaking Act of 2018 (Evidence
Act).

SUMMARY
TAT
EVALUATION PLAN
Introduction
Department of Labor's Mission:
To foster, promote, and develop the welfare of the wage earners, job seekers, and
retirees of the United States; improve working conditions; advance opportunities
for profitable employment; and assure work-related benefits and rights.
As outlined in DOL's Evaluation Policy, the importance of DOL's mission demands
continual innovation and improvement. Evaluating the effectiveness of our programs and
activities is key to this goal. Evaluations build high-quality evidence to help make DOL's
efforts as effective as possible.
On behalf of the department, CEO sponsors evaluation research related to the programs,
policies, and enforcement activities that DOL sub-agencies oversee across the United
States and internationally. CEO directly funds and oversees research activities and also
collaborates with DOL sub-agencies to design and conduct evaluations that they sponsor.
For all evaluations, CEO leverages protocols and practices to adhere to DOL's Evaluation
Policy principles of rigor, relevance, transparency, independence, and ethics.
The DOL Evaluation Plan satisfies two legislative requirements:
Studies directly sponsored by CEO using FY 2021 set-aside funding available for
evaluations of programs administered by specific DOL sub-agencies, as permitted by the
Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021ยน. These studies will be initiated by CEO
prior to September 30, 2022, and DOL notifies Congress of the intent to and purpose of
transfer set-aside funds to CEO, at least 15 days prior the funds transfer; and
Significant evaluations that the department plans to initiate through FY 2023, as required
by Title I the Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018 (Evidence
Act) and OMB Memorandums M-19-23 and M-21-27.
1Division H, Title I, Section 107 of Public Law 116-260,(pg. 381) of the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, authorizes the Secretary
of
Labor to reserve not more than 0.75 percent from specific budget accounts for transfer to and use by the Office of the Chief Evaluation Officer for
departmental program evaluation. It also requires Congressional notification of the intent to transfer funds and the planned projects.

INTRODUCTION
EVALUATION PLAN
The DOL Evaluation Plan communicates planned significant studies, that may be funded
through many sources including the authority to set-aside a portion of DOL funds for
evaluations. The studies in this plan are deemed "significant' based on their alignment to the
priorities of the agency and Administration, including those outlined in DOL's FY 2022-2026
Strategic Plan, and not on the basis of their dollar value or timeline to completion. Not all
evaluation efforts conducted at the Department of Labor are included in the DOL Evaluation
Plan, and some studies proposed may be dependent on future appropriations.
A
Collaborative Development Process
All studies included in the DOL Evaluation Plan are developed collaboratively with sub-
agency leaders and program experts, departmental leadership, and DOL's Evidence
Officials, including the Chief Evaluation Officer, the Chief Data Officer, the Statistical Official,
and the Director of the Performance Management Center.
As the studies outlined in this document move forward, CEO will continue to collaborate with
stakeholders and follow its Evaluation Policy to ensure that evaluations adhere to the most
rigorous methods possible and produce independent and credible findings that are relevant for
decision-makers.
Dissemination
CEO works to continuously improve its communication products and platforms to inform
diverse audiences interested in labor-related research, including policymakers, program
practitioners and decisionmakers, researchers, and the public. CEO's website and quarterly
newsletter provide various stakeholders with access to timely, relevant information to explore
timely labor topics and the growing evidence-base. CEO is also working to translate and
promote findings using research summaries to make research accessible for technical and
non-technical users. In the spirit of transparency, DOL posts completed evaluations and
research online. To view more details about ongoing and completed studies, please visit the
CEO website, or to learn timely updates, please subscribe to our quarterly newsletter by

Challenges
In addition to specific evaluation information below, the Office of Management and Budget's
guidance requires information about the anticipated challenges to implementing these
studies. Challenges for DOL evaluation research vary widely by design and methods but
often include issues with accessing and linking federal and state administrative datasets,
recruitment of sufficient sample sizes to allow for rigorous research designs, identification
of suitable counterfactual conditions and non-program participants, and attrition of
participants or beneficiaries from intended DOL program investments. CEO works closely
with independent contractors, DOL agency staff, state and local partners, and other
federal agencies, including the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and U.S.
Department of Education, to forecast and overcome challenges to individual studies.

Anticipated Challenges & Solutions

2. Reducing Barriers to Women's Employment
1. Data quality and completeness. At the time FEPLA was implemented, there were
no existing payroll codes for those using this leave; this data only started being
reported with routine codes more than six months after implementation. There are
also data quality issues within the payroll data, as agencies use differing payroll
systems and approaches and do not have a consistent data cleaning procedure.
To address this, we are proactively reviewing and cleaning FEPLA and leave data,
while also working to improve the overall quality of payroll data.
2. Selecting the appropriate time period for comparison. For comparisons of before
and after implementation of FEPLA, there are complicating factors regarding time
periods for comparison, including the lack of payroll codes and the COVID-19
pandemic, which is anticipated to have an effect on childbearing and leave taking
patterns. As such, we will carefully consider the appropriate time periods for both
before and after comparison and will interpret findings with caution.

WHD proposes using an outside vendor through CEO to design and implement the
survey. In addition, WHD's Office of Enterprise Data and Analytics could partner
with the vendor to review data and extract potential areas for focus in strategic
planning.
2. Achieving targeted survey response rates: WHD would support a CEO-led
convening of academics and researchers to discuss the challenges and solutions
for addressing response rates. WHD's communications team could partner with an
outside vendor to promote awareness of the survey and encourage participation.
