Department of Labor Equity Action Plan
Executive Summary
The U.S Department of Labor (DOL) is committed to improving the well-being of
underserved, marginalized, and excluded communities, recognizing that by doing so we
improve working conditions and economic opportunities for all workers. This document,
submitted in response to Executive Order 13985 on Advancing Racial Equity and Support for
Underserved Communities, summarizes key aspects of DOL's principles and approach to
advancing equity.
In subsequent sections, we detail five areas where DOL plans ambitious activity to support
underserved communities, including through: (1) enforcement of wage and hour laws; (2)
administering and improving the federal-state Unemployment Insurance system; (3)
broadening access to DOL programs, services, and information for workers with limited
English proficiency; (4) expanding sector-based training and employment strategies; and (5)
diversifying the federal workforce by building new pathways into government apprenticeships.
In each area, we identify barriers to more equitable access to programs and services for
relevant populations, detail steps to overcoming those barriers, and lay out planned activities
and accountability measures. These five areas represent only a portion of the equity work DOL
has carried out and is planning to implement over the coming years. But by releasing a
roadmap for these five high-impact program areas, we hope to help the communities we serve
better understand our vision for advancing equity-so that they can both give us input and hold
us accountable for meaningful change.

Mission and Introduction
The U.S. Department of Labor's (DOL, Department) mission is to "foster, promote, and
develop the welfare of the wage earners, job seekers, and retirees of the United States; improve
working conditions; advance opportunities for profitable employment; and assure work-related
benefits and rights." This mission translates into four core functions: (1) worker protection
(including protecting workers' wages, health and safety, and retirement savings, as well as the
rights of workers on federal contracts); (2) benefits administration (including overseeing the
federal-state Unemployment Insurance system and managing the federal workers compensation
system); (3) workforce development (including administering the federal workforce system);
and (4) development of labor market information (including the production of important
statistical series characterizing the workforce and the economy).
The charge we received through Executive Order 13985 on Advancing Racial Equity and
Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government complements and
reinforces the Department's core functions, which to be effective necessitate close attention to
the needs of workers who have faced and continue to face exclusion, marginalization, and
discrimination. Realizing the full promise of wage-and-hour laws, for instance, requires
assessing whether we are protecting the most vulnerable workers-such as low-paid workers,
women of color workers, LGBTQ+ workers, workers with disabilities, veterans, and immigrant
workers-who are most likely to experience violations of their rights. In a similar vein, the
federal-state Unemployment Insurance system fails to fulfill its objectives when large numbers
of workers-especially low-paid workers or workers of color-cannot access adequate benefits
in a timely manner.
The need to center underserved populations in the Department's work would be important at
any moment, but it is especially urgent as the country grapples with deep social and economic
disparities revealed and accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, the accompanying economic
crisis, and the current economic recovery. Not only were women, workers of color, immigrant
workers, low-paid service-sector workers, and other disadvantaged groups hit hardest by illness
and death, but they also suffered some of the largest economic damage. New federal actions,
bolstered by the passage of the American Rescue Plan and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, have
provided timely and much-needed support to these vulnerable communities and promise new
historic investments in the coming years. But more work remains to ensure that the Department
fully realizes its mission that all working people, jobseekers, and retirees have the economic
security, opportunity, and voice they need to thrive in our society.

Summary of Early Accomplishments
Over the past year, the Department of Labor has prioritized initiatives to center underserved
populations in how we develop and administer programs and policies. Below, we summarize
early actions already underway, noting that this list represents a small proportion of the overall
work DOL has carried out to support marginalized, vulnerable, and underserved communities.
Broadening the equity impacts of DOL grantmaking: DOL has established Department-
wide principles for advancing equity in our grantmaking, for instance, by removing barriers
to the participation of small, new, or emerging community-based organizations in the
grantmaking process; encouraging grantees to serve hard-to-reach and historically
underserved populations; building a pipeline of diverse community-based organizations
capable of delivering services to local communities; supporting existing grantees that
demonstrate commitments to expanding their own diversity, equity, and inclusion work;
and building accountability for equity in grant reporting requirements and associated
research and evaluation activities. In support of these principles, the Employment and
Training Administration (ETA) has developed a menu of options for DOL program offices
to select and customize when developing grantmaking opportunities. These include options
such as extending the open period for applications for certain grants, removing
requirements that may have hindered grantee diversity in the past, and increasing the points
given to grant applications that propose serving areas of greater need. ETA reviewed and
revised FY 2021 funding opportunities to incorporate these options. For instance, ETA's
community college investments now require colleges to identify and propose plans for
addressing and closing key equity gaps.
Understanding-and improving-the equity data we collect: Advancing equity requires
data in order to assess the needs of underserved populations, the scope of existing
programs, and the impacts of potential interventions. Last year, DOL conducted an
inventory of the equity-oriented data collected by agencies to better understand where there
are gaps in necessary data and opportunities for addressing those gaps. One issue identified
by this inventory involves missing demographic data for program participants, including
employment and training programs, which makes it more difficult to assess whether those
programs are reaching our nation's workers. ETA thus launched an analysis to better
understand the extent of missing demographic data, its impact on interpreting program
data, and options for improving data quality. Lessons from this project are being applied to
other programs (including new grant initiatives, within the bounds of federal
nondiscrimination law), to expand the collection of demographic data and improve its
quality, and to strengthen analyses of equitable access to programs and services.

MENT STATES OF
Centering vulnerable and underserved communities in the rulemaking process: As
part of the development of DOL's rulemaking agenda, program agencies have prioritized
initiatives which are especially important for low-paid workers, workers of color, and other
traditionally underserved communities. For instance, the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA) issued rules requiring employers to provide time off for
vaccination and recovery to remove obstacles to this life-saving protection for low-paid
workers in underserved communities. Additionally, OSHA has launched an enforcement
initiative on heat-related work hazards, which pose increasing risk to many workers as
climate change continues. OSHA also began its rulemaking process around a workplace
standard governing hazardous heat conditions, publishing an Advance Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking and seeking diverse stakeholder input. The Wage and Hour Division (WHD),
for its part, has engaged in rulemaking for tipped workers. Tipped workers are
disproportionately people of color and most are women. They suffer a poverty rate over
twice that of non-tipped workers. The rule helps ensure tipped workers are treated with
dignity and respect and that they receive the appropriate wage for the work they are
performing.
Building stronger partnerships with community-based organizations: Another cross-
cutting approach DOL is taking to advance equity is forging stronger partnerships with
community-based organizations that have trusted relationships and reach into traditionally
underserved populations. These partnerships can help workers better understand their
workplace rights and expand access to employment and training-related benefits and
services. These partnerships can also help DOL better understand the needs faced by
specific communities. For instance, the Veterans' Employment and Training Service
(VETS) launched an engagement initiative with Historically Black Colleges and
Universities (HBCUs) to help connect service members and veterans with employment
supports, spread awareness of VETS' work, and better understand the needs of underserved
communities of color and their intersection with service members and veterans. For its part,
the Office of Disability Employment Policy (ODEP) has launched several national online
dialogues to solicit broad stakeholder input on the effectiveness of employment programs
and services for people from underrepresented groups within the disability community.
ODEP has also entered in a formal alliance with the American Association for Access,
Equity, and Diversity, which includes a range of collaborative activities to advance
inclusion of people with disabilities into the workforce. OSHA is also expanding its own
alliance program to develop more voluntary, collaborative relationships with stakeholders,
especially those that can reach vulnerable worker populations.
Establishing equity focused Agency Priority Goals (APGs): APGs are two-year goals
that provide agencies a mechanism to focus leadership priorities, set outcomes, and
measure results, bringing attention to mission areas where agencies need to drive

STATES OF
significant progress and change. To highlight the importance of this initiative, DOL has
established an APG, An Economy for all Workers or "Equity APG", which encompasses
the equity initiatives of twelve DOL sub agencies. Equity is also a core component of the
Department's other two APGs: Strengthening America's Safety Net for Workers or "UI
APG" and Making Safe, Healthful, Fair-Paying and Equitable Workplaces a Priority or
"Worker Protection APG." These APGs prioritize the advancement of racial equity,
diversity, and inclusion, to better support underserved communities, and to hold the
Department accountable to this goal.

Equity Action Plan for Protection of Workers' Wage and Hour Rights
The Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division (WHD) aims to serve low-paid workers
and ensure that they are receiving all the wages they have earned. WHD cannot advance this
mission without addressing the impact of systemic inequities on its policies and programs.
Indeed, ongoing research suggests that economically marginalized and underserved workers
tend to be most vulnerable to wage and hour violations. Data from the Current Population
Survey, for instance, indicates that non-citizen workers, Hispanic workers, women workers,
and Black workers are especially likely to experience minimum wage violations-that is,
failure to receive earnings from their employers to which workers are legally entitled. The
pandemic, moreover, highlighted poor compensation and working conditions faced by many of
these workers in essential occupations and sectors who kept the country moving forward
during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Barriers to Equitable Outcomes
Concentration of underserved workers, especially workers of color, immigrant
workers, workers with disabilities, women, and workers with low levels of formal
education, in occupations and sectors especially prone to wage and hour violations
Lack of structures for communicating to workers about their workplace rights and
access and availability of channels for complaints
Worker fear of reporting potential violations due to employer retaliation, especially
retaliation related to perceived immigration status
Limited enforcement resources relative to the scale of the workforce served, with
approximately one WHD investigator for every 190,000 workers
Intended Impact on Barriers to Equity
Target WHD initiatives to sectors disproportionately employing low-paid, essential
workers most likely to experience wage and hour violations and where WHD
actions will amplify effects on employer practices
Improve workers' awareness of rights and knowledge of how to file complaints,
especially by targeting education and training campaigns to sectors and regions
most likely to have large proportions of vulnerable, low-paid workers and by
working through trusted channels of communication, like community-based
organizations
Maximize WHD capacity to identify and address retaliation against workers who
attempt to exercise their workplace rights, especially immigration-based retaliation
Develop and leverage strategic partnerships and memorandums of understanding
(MOUs) with other entities, including state and local governments and other federal
agencies, to yield the greatest possible protections for low-paid, vulnerable workers
Action, Tracking Progress, and Accountability
Maximize Strategic Partnerships with State and Local Governments Informed by a
Sector and Place-Based Enforcement Analysis

MENT STATES OF
WHD has historically focused enforcement on industries that employ some
of the lowest-paid workers with the highest rates of wage violations; in
addition, WHD will conduct a new enforcement analysis to understand
comparative labor standards offered by relevant worker protection laws,
including the scope of worker protections, the enforcement capacity of state
and local partners, and available remedies across the country
This enforcement analysis will answer the question, for each U.S. region
and industrial sector, what are the different sources of protection that
workers can expect to receive from different levels of government and
community partners?
The results of this enforcement analysis will inform the development of
strategic partnerships and MOUs to ensure that workers are receiving the
greatest possible protections through all tools available in particular regions
and sectors of the country
WHD will focus on ensuring that offices have the training, tools, and
resources needed to unleash the power of partnerships with state and local
governments, make MOUs more than commitments on paper, and ensure
that MOUs are aligned with the enforcement analysis described above.
These activities will be tracked as part of WHD's agency management plan,
and the Department will also be held accountable through its continuing
engagement with state and local governments and community and worker
organizations
Reaffirm WHD's Commitment to Preventing and Addressing Retaliation
All WHD field staff will receive training to identify and address workplace
retaliation, particularly immigration-based retaliation and the retaliation and
exploitation of vulnerable workers, under the acts enforced by WHD; these
trainings will also help investigators to identify more subtle or novel forms
of retaliation based on fact patterns that are raised by worker or community
stakeholders regularly interacting with vulnerable workers
This activity will be tracked as part of WHD's agency management plan,
and the Department will also be held accountable through its continuing
engagement with state and local governments and community and worker
organizations participating in strategic partnerships
WHD will track as a performance milestone the launch of an agency-
wide training initiative focused on retaliation and workplace crimes
Continue Conducting Equity-Focused Outreach to Essential Workers
WHD will continue to develop and disseminate worker-focused information
and resources to educate workers and raise public awareness of workers'
rights, including through posters, audio public service announcements,
digital advertising banners, webinars, and educational workshops
WHD will launch and track a media and outreach campaign focusing on
economically marginalized communities and make materials available in
multiple languages

future policies and practices; worker impact stories will be collected for
analysis and incorporated in future outreach events
This activity will be tracked as part of WHD's agency management plan,
and the Department will also be held accountable through its continuing
engagement with state and local governments and community and worker
organizations participating in strategic partnerships
Develop Strategic Partnerships with Community-Based Organizations, Worker
Centers, Unions, and Industry Associations
Many local and regional offices have spent years developing and
maintaining meaningful strategic partnerships with community-based
organizations, worker centers, unions, industry associations, consulates,
faith-based organizations, and worker advocacy groups; many of these
organizations work closely with vulnerable communities, including
vulnerable communities of color, and are trusted by workers
WHD will empower each level of the agency-local, regional, and
national-to maximize the full potential of these strategic partnerships by
providing training, resources, and guidance to ensure meaningful
relationships that can impact these communities
This activity will be tracked as part of WHD's agency management plan,

Equity Action Plan for Unemployment Insurance
The federal-state Unemployment Insurance (UI) system offers crucial income replacement to
workers who have lost a job for good cause or through no fault of their own, as well as
macroeconomic support for the overall economy during downturns. During the pandemic, UI
benefits helped over 53 million workers and put some $800 billion into the economy.
Despite its important relief and stimulative effects, UI's reach across jobless workers remains
uneven. While different data sources sometimes point in different directions, the overall picture
is that the current system of unemployment insurance-both before and during the pandemic-
provides unequal access to benefits for marginalized communities, including racial and ethnic
minorities, low-paid and part-time workers, workers with limited English proficiency, and
workers with lower levels of formal education. For instance, pre-pandemic, unemployed Black
workers were 21% less likely to receive benefits than white workers, according to the 2018
Current Population Survey UI Non-Filers Supplement. The gap by education was even larger:
30% of jobless workers with at least a college degree reported receiving benefits in 2018,
compared to just 11% of workers with less than a high school degree.
In light of these equity gaps, the Department of Labor is engaged in a comprehensive effort to
improve timely access to benefits for eligible workers, above all for workers historically
underserved by the UI system.
Barriers to Equitable Outcomes (Depending on State Given Federal-State Structure of
Program)
Lack of structures for communicating with workers about their eligibility for
benefits, the application process, and how to fulfill requirements for continuing to
receive benefits (like ongoing certification of work search effort)
Cumbersome application and ongoing certification processes impose barriers on
underserved communities, including individuals with limited internet access,
limited English proficiency, disabilities, and low trust in government
Large backlogs of claims may have a disparate impact on individuals with historical
barriers to access
Fraud and identity verification detection methods may deter or disproportionately
flag as ineligible underserved workers, especially workers of color or individuals
who have changed names or genders
Lack of disaggregated data on program access by demographic characteristics
prevents regular equity tracking that could promote accountability and inform
changes to program laws and administration
Intended Impact on Barriers to Equity
Promote greater worker awareness and knowledge about the program, including by
conducting more outreach, training, education, and assistance
Piloting efforts to streamline benefits application and certification, including by
using more plain language in program communications, reengineering benefits

faster and less burdensome on workers
Reducing backlogs that have disparate impacts on underserved communities,
including through process engineering and supporting new hires
Revise fraud detection tools to ensure that screening methods do not have disparate
impacts on underserved communities, while still effectively combatting fraud
Create new indicators of program access and barriers to identify equity gaps using
UI program data, including key measures like application, recipiency, denial, and
timeliness rates broken out by demographic groups (especially race, ethnicity,
education, age, gender, disability status, geographic area, and language proficiency)
Action, Tracking Progress, and Accountability
Tiger Team Initiative
Multi-disciplined "Tiger Teams" are being sent to individual states to
identify technological, operational, and administrative short-term solutions
in the areas of equitable access, timeliness, and fraud reduction
Participating states will demonstrate gains in equity of recipiency and
develop baseline measurements for the timeliness of benefits across racial
demographics, and other attributes of underserved communities
Equity Grants to States (through Unemployment Insurance Program Letter No. 23-
21)
This funding opportunity provides up to $260 million in grants to states to
promote equitable access to UI programs, including by eliminating
administrative barriers to benefits applications, reducing state workload
backlogs, improving the timeliness of payments to eligible individuals, and
ensuring equity in fraud prevention, detection, and recovery activities
States submitted applications by the end of calendar year 2021; as part of
their grant applications, states identified specific outcome measures tied to
their proposed equity-related activities
These outcome measures will be used to track the impact of their efforts; for
instance, if grant funds were used to modify IT systems to allow individuals
with two-letter last names or two-word last names to successfully submit an
initial claim electronically, the state might measure first payment timeliness
for those groups of claimants
Equity grantee performance will be tracked as part of the Department's
strategic plan; in addition, the Department will track state and claimant
feedback on this initiative through ongoing engagements with state UI
agencies and claimant groups
Pilot Navigator Grants to States (through forthcoming Unemployment Insurance
Program Letter)
This funding opportunity provides up to $15 million in grants to states to
create navigator programs-partnerships between state UI agencies and
community-based organizations-to help underserved workers learn about,
apply for, and if eligible, receive UI benefits

Community-based organizations participating as navigators will also
regularly report on barriers experienced by the populations they are serving
to state agencies and DOL; these organizations will then work with state UI
agencies to collaboratively address identified barriers
The Department will help states and community-based organizations better
target their efforts by sharing equity indicators that can inform outreach,
education, training, and assistance activities
As a condition of receiving the grant, states and community navigators will
participate in an evaluation conducted by the Department of Labor to
identify promising practices and scalable approaches for future navigator
initiatives
Navigator grantee performance will be tracked as part of the Department's
strategic plan; in addition, the Department will convene a learning

Elizabeth Brandeis UI Equity Research to Action Center
The Department of Labor's Chief Evaluation Office is launching a grant
competition for an academic institution (or network of institutions) to create
a new center to conduct and disseminate research related to the UI system,
with a cross-cutting focus on equity in program administration and
outcomes
The research center will support training and teaching, data collection,
research and evaluation, and outreach and education to researchers,
practitioners, program administrators, policymakers, and the general public
An important priority for the research center's work is recruiting, retaining,
and training diverse students, scholars, and researchers, especially scholars
and students who are affiliated with institutions that have not had the
capacity to mentor students or conduct research on the UI program in the
past
Another important priority for the research center's work involves
lartnership-building-including with state UI agencies, community and
worker organizations, and the Department of Labor-to make the evidence
that the research center generates actionable; this includes providing
expertise to DOL and state UI agencies on research and evaluations, public
programming, events, and trainings, and fellowship programs to bring
researchers into government, for instance, to DOL through
Intergovernmental Personnel Act assignments

These partnerships will produce indicators of application, recipiency, denial,
and timeliness by demographic groups and across regions within a state that
state UI agencies can use to inform changes to program administration to
improve equity for underserved populations, including through new
outreach, education, and training
States can use funds from the Equity Grants described above for these

The Department is currently moving ahead with partnerships in five states,
and plans to release initial results for these states by summer 2022
The Department will recruit more states throughout 2022 and 2023, and will
also produce broader lessons learned from these partnerships that will be

MENT STATES OF
Equity Action Plan for Improving Language Access
Carrying out the mission of the Department of Labor requires reaching all segments of the
population, including those individuals with limited English proficiency (LEP). According to
the latest data available from the American Community Survey, in 2019 8.5% of the labor
force reported limited English proficiency, totaling over 14 million workers. Data suggest that
LEP workers are disproportionately likely to experience workplace violations, like wage theft,
and during the COVID-19 pandemic language barriers posed significant risks to LEP workers
who were unable to receive important health and safety information from employers or
government agencies. The Department is committed to ensuring that all workers, including
LEP workers, are fully aware of their rights, knowledgeable about the process for exercising
their rights in the event of a potential violation, and able to report any suspected violations to
appropriate authorities without fear of retaliation. Language access barriers prevent LEP
workers from fully participating in programs and activities, and receiving important services
provided by DOL.
Barriers to Equitable Outcomes
Translation and language access activities are frequently decentralized across each
of the Department's agencies, with each agency being responsible for identifying
and funding the language access needs of the populations they serve
As a result of this decentralization, agency compliance with language access
requirements has been inconsistent and, at times, runs the risk of being insufficient
to fulfill the Department's interests and responsibilities of reaching all workers, and
especially vulnerable workers
Intended Impact on Barriers to Equity
Improved understanding of the language needs of the populations we serve across
all Departmental agencies
Increasing internal DOL language capacity through hiring and retaining more
bilingual and multilingual staff
Development of centralized resources for Departmental agencies to use to meet
needs for individual programs and populations served
More Departmental information resources and interactions available in the
languages used by populations served

to more non-English language speaking communities that may be at risk for
workplace safety and health dangers
MSHA is planning several initiatives to expand its reach to Spanish
language-speaking populations, including by recruiting for new bilingual
positions in regions where there is a mining community that is
predominantly Spanish-speaking, developing more bilingual signs to inform
mine workers of health and safety risks in languages they can read and

Greater Department-wide Language Access Planning
The Department is requesting funds to support a centralized team, staffed at
both the national and regional levels by the Civil Rights Center and the
Office of Public Affairs, to develop greater consistency in the delivery of
language access services across all Department agencies and programs
This centralized language access team would also develop and provide
training to DOL employees on language access policies and procedures,
oversee the ongoing translation of vital information on DOL's website, and
ensure the Department's digital communications are reaching LEP
communities
The centralized language access team would use existing data along with
new surveys of Departmental agency staff to better understand language
needs for common material (such as the Department's website) as well as

MENT STATES OF
Equity Action Plan for Workforce Training
The mission of the public workforce system is to develop the welfare of job seekers by
improving their working conditions and advancing opportunities for profitable employment. To
accomplish this goal and foster equity, the Department must center historically marginalized
and underserved workers and job seekers. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, the
Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the unemployment rate for Black workers was 6.1%
compared to 3.3% for white workers. These disparities have persisted through the pandemic
and the recovery; as of November 2021, Black workers are 65% more likely to be unemployed
than their white counterparts.
In order to realize its mission, the Department must intensify its focus on workers who have
been and continue to be marginalized in the public workforce system and the labor market.
Barriers to Equitable Outcomes
Outreach efforts are necessary to understand the unique challenges faced by
members of underserved communities in accessing ETA programs, services, and
benefits, and to achieve equitable outcomes
Missing data and incomplete demographic data creates challenges in assessing the
equity of access to services and outcomes within workforce programs; deeper
analysis into workforce performance data is required to identify programmatic
barriers to marginalized job seekers and set accountability goals
Current discretionary grant policies and processes may limit the ability of smaller
diverse organizations to access federal workforce funding; these organizations,
often based locally in underserved communities, may be particularly well
positioned to address the regional training, education, and labor market barriers of
job seekers
Specific populations, like individuals who were formerly incarcerated and at-risk
youth, may require additional support and programs to address their unique
challenges
Workforce development training and services that do not lead to actual job
placements or that result in low quality employment, particularly for workers from
underserved communities
Intended Goals to Address Barriers to Equity
Identify programmatic barriers, through workforce system data analysis, that
prevent underserved populations from receiving full and equitable access to
workforce services and establish performance measures to drive accountability
Establish and maintain strong relationships with stakeholders representing
underserved communities to better understand and address the needs of the
community
Leverage stakeholder feedback and data analytics to identify barriers in the
equitable distribution of discretionary grant funding and create performance
measures to incentivize behaviors that will advance equity goals

barriers that prevent organizations representing underserved communities
from receiving discretionary grant funding; this includes a review of the
discretionary grantmaking process, including conducting analysis on
grantees, participants served, and associated outcomes to identify
opportunities to advance equity goals and develop performance measures
and milestones to drive accountability in FY23
ETA and VETS will assess the developmental phase in grantmaking to
identify opportunities for pre-notices, stakeholder engagements, and other
tools to increase feedback opportunities for stakeholders, test and assess the
feasibility of the proposed approaches as well as an extended application
period
In order to identify and eliminate outdated and unnecessary requirements
and inform planning and procedures for the FY 2023 grant year, ETA and
VETS will conduct a retrospective review of FY 2022 grants and program
designs and issue new guidelines as appropriate
ETA and VETS will be held accountable for the completion of these
activities through milestones tracked in agency management plans
Pilot Programs and Services, Issue Grants, and Provide Technical Assistance (TA)
to Mitigate Deep Barriers Faced by Specific Populations
ETA will continue to invest in employment and training services for those
most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, including historically
marginalized groups such as women, people of color, immigrants, youth,
persons with disabilities, and justice-impacted individuals, among others by
providing TA on evidence-based strategies to improve employment
outcomes for program participants
As part of a White House-led effort to incorporate Community Violence
Intervention (CVI) strategies, ETA will inform, support, and fund workforce
system practitioners to participate in CVI; in addition to issuing guidance to
grantees and leading cross-agency guidance for community-wide impact,
ETA will award Reentry Employment Opportunities (REO) youth grants
that focus on CVI strategies and best practices for serving populations that
have higher incidents of poverty and homelessness

ETA will continue testing and evaluating pre-release services for
incarcerated individuals, through a third round of the Pathways Home grants
in FY 2022
ETA will continue administering the WIOA Indian and Native American
Program (INAP) and publish a funding opportunity to award INAP grants;
ETA plans to continue engaging with the Native American Employment and
Training Council and to consider their recommendations on INAP program
administration
ETA will continue to implement State Apprenticeship Expansion, Equity,
and Innovation (SAEEI) grants that bolster states' efforts to expand
programming and recruitment strategies to attract a diverse workforce
ETA will be held accountable for the completion of these activities through
milestones tracked in the agency management plan
Establish and Invest in Industry and Sector-based High Road Training Partnerships
(HRTPs) that Build Pathways to Quality Jobs for Vulnerable Workers.
ETA will invest in high road training partnerships (HRTPs) that bring
together workers, labor and other worker organizations, employers, and
training providers to collaborate in developing industry and sector-based
workforce solutions that focus on equity and job quality
By establishing a framework in which industry leaders (workers, labor, and
employers) and training entities partner to address industry and workforce
needs in real-time, HRTPs provide marginalized workers with pathways to
quality jobs (including actual employment in good jobs), while employers
benefit from a skilled workforce and increased market competitiveness
ETA will consider how to integrate the HRTP approach into existing
discretionary grants to promote economic mobility and equitable access to
good jobs for underserved and marginalized workers

Equity Action Plan for Government Apprenticeships
Advancing equity requires a qualified and diverse Federal Government workforce that is
representative of the communities that it serves. One way to advance this goal is through
developing Government Apprenticeships that can provide new pathways to federal service for
job applicants and help close the gap for the demand for skilled workers.
Barriers to Equitable Outcomes
Existing hiring practices and pre-qualifications may inadvertently dissuade or
exclude otherwise talented and diverse candidates from accessing employment
apprenticeship opportunities in the Federal Government
Recruitment geography for most Federal Government jobs is often limited to larger,
high-cost metropolitan areas (e.g., San Francisco, CA; Washington, D.C.; Boston,
Massachusetts) which may be a deterrent for talented individuals unable or
unwilling to relocate away from their families and communities
Lack of support for relocation and completion of apprenticeship programs (e.g.,
transportation, flexible timing, access to childcare, and support for additional
education, training, and pre-apprenticeship opportunities)
Intended Impact on Barriers to Equity
Provide new pathways for diverse candidates to find employment in the Federal
Government through developing a framework for Public Service/Federal
Government Registered Apprenticeships that other program offices or agencies can
implement
Expand the recruitment pool by leveraging Historically Black Colleges and
Universities (HCBUs), other educational institutions serving diverse populations,
national advocacy organizations, and other local community partners that can help
promote on-ramps to Registered Apprenticeship opportunities; evaluating eligibility
for supports for unemployed, underemployed, underrepresented individuals, as well
as communities that have been adversely impacted by the pandemic to align with
the President's diversity and reemployment goals
Provide support, including mentors/coaches or other supportive services, needed to
persist, succeed, and complete an apprenticeship program
Action, Tracking Progress, and Accountability
Conduct Stakeholder Outreach to Government Agencies
Host listening sessions with existing federal agencies that sponsor existing
apprenticeship programs to identify best practices and lessons learned
Establish a partnership effort with the Office of Personnel Management
(OPM) to explore opportunities to expand public service apprenticeships,
particularly in common occupations across the Federal Government
Launch Apprenticeship Programs within DOL and Beyond

MENT STATES OF
ETA plans to lead by example by launching an internal apprenticeship
program based on the successful pathways apprenticeship program DOL
piloted several years ago; the goal is to develop a framework and structure
that other DOL agencies and offices can eventually utilize
ETA is working with other agencies within DOL to explore opportunities to
expand apprenticeship across the Department
ETA plans to track development of Federal Government Registered
Apprenticeship Programs in the Registered Apprenticeship Partners
Information Management Data System (RAPIDS)
Innovate Recruitment and Support Strategies to Target Public Service/Federal
Government Registered Apprenticeship Opportunities for Underrepresented
Communities by Expanding Jobs to the Areas in Which They Live
Widely publicize recruitment for key positions used across multiple
agencies (e.g., program analysts, program specialists, training
representatives, project and contracting officers, etc.) to create economies of
scale in on-boarding and training apprentices
Work with OPM to consider options for larger-scale recruitment and
pathway opportunities that can benefit multiple agencies in need of more
Federal workers, while offering greater flexibilities that expand jobs to more
localities
Consider using "Opportunity Zones" and other areas highlighted by the
Federal Government with grants and incentives for DEIA development and
support to define geographic areas
Use existing resources such as the Universal Outreach Tool to help with
targeting and outreach
