## Our (Supernatural) Vision
We think existing NLP tools and emerging AI tools can **<span style="color:#1696d2;">power up existing research</span>** and **<span style="color:#1696d2;">unlock new research questions that weren't previously possible.</span>**

## The (Haunted) Problem We Are Best Positioned to Solve
- There are massive amounts of information, either scrapeable from website(s), or already collected in lengthy transcripts, case notes, or other forms, that can be **<span style="color:#1696d2;">synthesized into actionable insights</span>**.
- Collecting and sifting through this information is **<span style="color:#1696d2;">time-consuming and often unfeasible</span>** for researchers to do manually.


## Tricks and Treats For This Bottleneck
::: {.panel-tabset}
### Basic Text Analysis
- Think of as "advanced CTRL+F"
- Flag key search terms and the windows of text around them
- Help you make manual review more targeted and efficient

### Advanced Text Analysis
- Semantic ("smart") search
- Name-entity tagging to pull out important entities (people, places, organizations)
- Topic modeling to find latent themes in text

## Tricks and Treats For This Bottleneck

### Extractive AI
- Give Large Language Model (LLM) a prompt to find and pull out specific text or answers from body of documents
- Can be great for parsing through table data or cases where you may not know all the search terms

### Generative AI
- Ask AI to generate insights, summaries, or recommendations based on the text
- This is a place where we still have much to learn ourselves!

## Your (Eerie) Enquiries
- How much do I need to know about AI?
- What kinds of data work well these tools? How about confidential data?
- I hear AI can hallucinate, so how can we trust and verify it?
- What if I am concerned about these tools replacing my expertise?

## What are *Our* Eeriest Enquiries?
- Which specific platforms, models, and cost structures should Urban use in AI for research?
- What are the exact use cases where we would *always* or *never* want to suggest an AI-based solution?
- What are our blind spots?

## Demo Time!
[Not sure if this should go at end or after text analysis sections Manu?]
